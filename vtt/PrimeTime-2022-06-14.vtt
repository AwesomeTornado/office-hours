00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
All right, so welcome to office hours. This is the office hours for AMA for mr. Prime and yes and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.040
Hello, if you have questions, please drop them in the office hours channel. That's two above where it currently is

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.740
I do have a couple of sort of bits of preamble first of which is people notice my patreon

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.480
Thank you so much for those that have subscribed to my patreon

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.680
I did want to clarify that before any sort of rumors or Twitter threads or anything like that happened

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.620
I'll also be producing a I don't know post or video or something about it

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.820
That patreon is if you wish to support me me personally if you want to support Neos the company do the Neos patreon that gets

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.620
You the storage space if you want to support fructs personally do tricks patron. I'm just what me personally then

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.860
That's okay for me as for you get when you're doing that nothing currently I might add some perks

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.980
But they're not going to be any sort of perks that you want to write home about

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.620
a bare minimum perk will probably just be like hey you're in my youtube video description for every video whilst you're a patron which is

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.140
Standard stuff until your patron this gets too big and then you put it in my credits in the video and stuff like that

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.860
but yeah

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.020
We're not gonna have cringy stuff, and no explicit perks unless you have ideas for perks in which case go for them

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.740
If you're interested probably enough talking about that just one final note there though any money submitted to that is not going to be used for

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.100
Guns or explosions or cool cars. It's gonna be used for buying cheese buying groceries or buying

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.860
Food basically like that's that's all it would be used for I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.380
Literally I did a I did a funny. I push the wrong button there, but you know there we go

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.140
That it's just like it's literally there like you know I know some people are like oh

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.460
Yeah, I'm gonna get money from patreon buy fast cars right now. I'll never buy a car

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.940
It's like no. I'll never buy a car. I can't currently legally drive, so if it's there. It's for food. Thank you

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.660
Otherwise cheese on to questions. Oh, that's the other thing if Neos ever gets to the point where it's able to actually purchase me

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.340
Purchase me that sounds wrong if it's able to get to the point where it can pay me and whatever fashion that is I will

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.020
Cancel that patreon and focus it back towards yes

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.860
That's that and for those sitting in here going like oh, so it was about the money after all

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.060
It's not about the money

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.500
It's about the things that like are around that right do I want to like quit my job and work on near stuff all time

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.020
Yes, would I do that in the current circumstances?

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.380
No, not if nears the company had a check for a million dollars that would not happen so do keep that in mind

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.380
It is still not about the money

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.840
You know if I offered you to if I were to you a check for like a million dollars for you to be inside an

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.600
incredibly loud boiling room full of sound and needles and sharp objects and glass and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.360
lectures about the nature of reality

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.200
So you know you're in pain. You can't move you're very hot. You'd say no. Just just think about that money isn't everything

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120
So now we'll move on to questions

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.200
So Ozzy ask real question real quick question can anim J track the use of bull fours

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.520
Um probably I don't know the advice I have of anim J is if you go ahead and take

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.920
Take an object and run it through the to string node

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.800
You'll see what anim J representation should be applicable for it

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.120
For example if you if you go like if you have a float three like you might write a float three

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.840
And I know this is just in the chat and not the recording

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.320
But whatever you write it as like three numbers with a comma in between so

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.080
120 50 10 like that's a float 3 and then if you to string that you'll see something along the lines of this

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.120
Which exists in the anim J as a serialized thing the reason why it's using those brackets

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.120
And it's using semicolons rather than colons

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.920
Commas even is because it's going into Jason and commas away than Jason as our quote, so it's using that as a different thing

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.520
So if you to string something you'll usually see what it might be able to be looked at like in anim J

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.840
What I want to do a minute every like eventually for anim J is I want to basically take a lot of c-sharp data structures

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.000
That I can code in c-sharp right so if I write a float for a blue for or whatever in c-sharp

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.120
I know it's correct as c-sharp has you know runtime detection on that and then say cool now reverse

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.160
Generate an anim J file for that and then that can form actually part of like an automated test for anim J as well

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.720
Right so we we take a c-sharp file

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.160
We generate an anim J file from it, and then we check that that match is an expected known value

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.880
So prime looks over the class goes like cool prime looks over the generated output and goes cool

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.920
Then we lock those together in the form of a testing contract and then if one side breaks or the other side breaks

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.240
We know that there is a problem with anim J for those who aren't aware about how testing works in software

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.160
That's how it works right you read over the code once and you're like I am asserting me

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.280
probable prime emperor of this c-sharp class

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.040
says that this is what this program should output and then six months later where

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.440
new person on the team

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.120
Clarence makes a code change and accidentally break something because they're new the test go nah, sorry bro

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.760
It's wrong, and then it's caught before it goes to production. That's that's testing for you. We want to do more testing

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.960
On neos as well just to make sure that stuff doesn't break or that we know and stuff is about to break things like that

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.960
so we actually have

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.480
We have some testing and some benchmarking on a new node which isn't in the release yet due to hashtag announcements

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.120
On counter currencies we have benchmarking to prove that the counter currencies implementation is the fastest we can get it to very interesting right up

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.840
On that one. I actually might write that up in a blog somewhere at some point

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.400
Yeah, and then we have testing to make sure that it works appropriately the same with a couple of other nodes

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.160
Which are sort of escaping and escaping strings some advancements to those I had to write a bunch of tests for those again

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.560
That's tested right so forever breaks. We can test it. That's great

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.820
I know that's a tangent away from an MJ, but it leads to the point of the matter

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.580
Which is like an MJ doesn't have those right now, and so we some cases don't know

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.160
But if you to string it you sometimes get an approximation, and then you can try and chuck it in that's that question

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.440
Moving on to the next question

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.280
Spec says that they don't know the session metrics, okay, I still don't know and the problem is like it's not

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.660
Notated I'm gonna go ahead and open up the code base. I actually didn't look for you

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.800
I looked in Neos, but I didn't look in the actual code

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.260
So I open up the code base that takes a couple of minutes and then in gaps between any questions. I'll take a look oh

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.600
Interesting. Thank you for that example. That is not how to string would represent it at all

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.480
Interesting does a flip for look like sorry flip for looked like a the bracket he stuff. That's cool X

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.800
We should maybe collaborate on those tests

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.160
I can reckon to write those now because like you can write tests about later shipping codes to productions

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.880
Oh

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.560
You found out it is milliseconds. Yes of course. I didn't read till the end sometimes. I do skim read

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.560
It's just the nature of being sort of live on sage at sage. Yes

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.360
I'm on top of a pile of sage the best herb in the world for those who are here

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.000
Who are aware of what sage is sage and onion stuffing?

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.880
Just give me like a whole plate of stuffing. I remember I had I lived with a

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.140
Roommate back in my university days, and they love stuffing so much

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.560
They would just buy like the you know stuffing powder you mix in water

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.020
Maybe some milk sometimes you just get like a plate of stuffing and he would just eat that like all times of the year

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.700
Sometimes it stuck up on it

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.440
I've never really had that reaction except to eggnog like I hate the fact that eggnog is only available in December

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.000
I don't really drink eggnog before I came to America, but every like every December now. I'm just like I

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.040
Can't hold these liters of eggnog and for those who say like but you know you could make it at home

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.200
And I'm just like yeah, I could also like you know follow Bob Ross's painting tutorials

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.920
Or like you know learn a musical instrument, but what egg dogs available in the shops?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.160
I could just pick up liters of and take it home

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.080
I always forget the recipe as well, and you're unlike any alcohol to eggnog

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.280
It's great you warm up a little bit, and it's just like oh anyway. I think that's all the questions. We've got right now

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.560
That's why I'm talking about eggnog. Well the problem is shelf life right so

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.860
You know that there is a lot of you might all know

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.100
But most of you should know there is a lot of wastage in the sort of grocery department like when you're walking through the grocery

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.320
hour next time

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.360
You're shopping, and you will past all the meat like what past you know the steak the ground beef the ground chicken the sausages walk

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:31.680
Down that entire aisle if no one buys the like rotting deceased animals that are in those counters

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.300
They will be thrown out by the grocery store, and it's just like brain is just like

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.040
It's just weird right, but that's the grocery

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.640
industry same thing with

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.380
Eggnog right if no one buys the eggnog then it's just gonna rot and they have to throw it out

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.760
So yeah, okay prime might come in and buy seven liters a week

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.320
But they've got like a hundred leaders out back because they don't know that prime exists

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.840
They can't plan for that if there's like long shelf life eggnog it probably tastes worse. I know there's like long shelf life

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.480
Milk which is usually like tastes weird because they like they put it in like canned milk or something

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.320
They put it in like they do a different type of treatment so that it can be have a long shelf life

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.580
I've considered getting powdered milk. I know this is completely off topic, but like hey

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:23.400
This is this is why you come to office hours come on. This is why you come you come in for random prime stories

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.400
Whenever I need milk. It's like

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.280
Usually 10 milliliters or less

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.240
It's like a teaspoon or whatever for cooking and I buy like a container of milk

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:38.520
And then it just goes off or and here's the alternative or I buy an entire box of cereal and a carton of milk

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:44.840
And they're both gone within 24 hours. I just can't I can't process milk as a regular human being

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.280
Where like you have a carton in the fridge at all times?

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.800
That does it just doesn't occur to me

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:57.220
It's either like in a bowl of cereal or it's off that that the two states of milk for prime

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.560
I was debating whether to go into the story of how to dispose of

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.840
milk

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.720
Now let's not do that because I have a special mechanism for getting rid of off milk

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.380
Okay back on topic from unnamed cyborg cat. Thank you so much

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.380
When

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.900
Will needs be finished or at least it is released it's released into early access

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.900
I know the early access gets a lot of sort of stick in the community and that's because it

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.220
You know, there are games that stay in early access forever. I'm not calling this game out

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.940
I'm just mentioning I'm aware of in the press that this is happening a lot for this game seven days to die has been an

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.260
Early access for a long time

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:35.740
I

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:41.300
Bought seven days to die off steam like a long time ago and I would have to like rummage through my email accounts to

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.580
Find out which email I bought it from so that's interesting

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:50.420
I keep playing early access games aren't completed and I hit like a content or like I did that was satisfactory for those who don't

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.220
Know satisfactory you get to like phase

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.420
For whatever you just send up and they give you a coffee cup and that's it because they don't have any more content

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.660
I'm about to hit that wall with a game called grounded, which is really cool. Well you play as a

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.100
Shrunken children in a forest of it's not actually a forest. It's a lawn

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.020
You know

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.980
You have to try and do stuff to get back up to your regular size and again, there's just a content wall

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.100
It's like sorry guys. We didn't finish the game. It's the nature of early access. So

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:23.260
Actually answer the question with that pre-facing never update 6 is coming out update 6 just talks about sorry

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.020
we're talking about satisfactory update 6 just changes the the

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.780
The biomes the biome generation and rebalances combat a little bit. That is good content

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:38.020
Unfortunately, it is changing the biome completely of where my main base in my main satisfactory save is

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.340
Located because we chose to build it there before we knew that that was going to happen

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.500
so I predict after the update when I load the save that I have it's just gonna be like

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.820
Off your factories in the side of a mountain. Whoo

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.700
I would like satisfactory to have an update where there is an end of the game. I don't know

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.380
That's only access for you know, but going back to to near stem gums. I

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:06.580
I don't think it'll ever be finished or released. There will come a time some time in the future where

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.280
There are no more updates. I know there are no updates right now

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:16.480
Let's just imagine for just like 30 minutes, please that Neos is doing fantastic right now, please. It makes conversations a lot more sort of

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.220
Empathic and good to have

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.900
At some point in the future this situation not withstanding

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:30.060
There will no longer be an update. Let's say 20 years in the future 30 years in the future

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.060
You're like ancient you sat on a rocking chair

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.260
You've got a blanket on your legs your family all around you and you can barely walk three steps

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.300
And you know, you're just like back in my day

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.980
prime talked about cheese

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:51.060
You know and we didn't have all these features at some point. It's just gonna happen right the game will just stop having updates

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:56.420
At that point, could you say it was finished? Yeah, probably not though

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.820
There was probably like a realm of stuff that we still intended to do like I used to work on mixer

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.840
And again, we had a realm of stuff that we just intended to do but because mixer shut down it was therefore

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.300
Colloquially known as being finished right? I have notes in a notebook. That's on my desk

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.780
It's almost out as my work notebook and it's still caught mixer notes from features in it

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.780
I have to keep those until I if I whatever leave the job

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.380
But then I kind of have to sort of turn that notebook to them or shred it or something

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.900
I don't remember which I'll read when it comes to that. So there you go. There's the answer to that question

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.620
Now onwards to more content 15 minutes in we're still talking about random stuff

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.920
Roussia says not a question the amateur radio project with the red sockets caught it with the red sockets

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:46.020
So catchy good piece of software red red. No, no red. Anyway web sockets causing red nodes

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:51.780
I separated the important radio control and signal report data into two separate web sockets and add an impulse timer on the signal report web socket

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.860
No, it does appear to have prevented the red nodes from happening. Absolutely. Yeah split the logics up

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.140
split things up split things into data channels and make sure the only

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.640
Processing data at the speed that you need to process it out or slow down that data and you'll have a much better time

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.780
If you're worried about now that your project is now using two web socket nodes

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.340
What I want you to go do is to go to any popular website Facebook Twitter

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:19.220
You name it whatever you want to do YouTube's another good one open up the developer tools and then go to the network tab

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.100
And then hit refresh and then just like die. It's just like

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.660
There's just like thousands of

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:34.380
Business pieces of data just coming in and all they do is they represent cat memes on your computer entering your brain through your eyes

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.220
It's very interesting how the way the world has worked. So don't worry about complexity is what I'm saying if it works

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.380
Cool moving on to Lexus question

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.320
Which is any specific reason why the enos API is not cause compatible not having the required cause headers to a crosstalk way

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.260
Peter web API access like an explicit decision or

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.700
Because it's not supposed to be used. I know I'm paraphrasing that a lot. I apologize. I'll just sum up

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:05.140
So Lex is asking why the nearest API doesn't have cause headers cause is cross origin request

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.980
something

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:14.000
Sometimes I know what an abbreviation means, but I don't know what the abbreviation expands to if that makes sense. So cause is

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.360
Really cool

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.800
No, we don't have the headers there it allows

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.760
Other websites in the browser to talk to the API

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.200
It can be a security preventative measure to explicitly out out of cause headers

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.160
We don't have them because we haven't made a decision either way

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
When it comes to web services

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:41.520
Fruxy is is less knowledge about about those than other things such as no nears his actual engine. And so

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.040
Some of those decisions just either weren't made simply through time or weren't made because they don't know about them

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.740
I'm not trying to say hey fricks didn't know about that. They're bad or anything like that

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.200
What I'm trying to say here is sometimes stuff is just overlooked

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.280
Above all the other things I do in news

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.520
One of the reasons why I joined the team is actually to help out on the website side of things, right?

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.520
I am a web developer

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.840
Engineer, whatever you want to call it by trade and have been for a long long long long long time

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.880
So I can help out with things like that

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:17.000
We would have to have a discussion as a team about what we want to do about cause and particularly would have to speak to

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Developers that require cause see what their needs are

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.320
because I don't think we'll be able to enable cause on every single like API and

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.300
Would have to maybe decide which ones we wanted to enable them

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.620
Additionally, we need to make sure that the API is actually usable right now

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.840
The fact that you're using it is kind of just like a small miracle

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.320
Like any update could break it right now. We have nothing locked its contracts

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.520
We see you commented that

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.000
Everything is actually implemented in node-red. That's fantastic

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I really want to look at node-red

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.960
But like I got kind of put off because I'd have to set up a server

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.820
One of my principles right now is to just do serverless everything

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.340
So I need to look at node-red again and see if there's an easy way to run it

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.440
I just like not having machines running somewhere that I have to like SSH into it

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.960
It puts me off and with that we'll wait for more questions. Thank you so much guys. All right

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.920
I'm just you know, double enforcing. Hey, if you have any questions, please

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.080
the office hours channel that is two channels above the one you clicked to get to this meeting and

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.100
I'll answer them as soon as I get to them as there are no questions. I get to ask you guys a question

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.920
So do you have any tutorial requests currently? I know I've been like absent on the tutorial front for a while

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.520
That's because of the channel that's announcements. It's also because of a couple of personal things

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.860
If you have any requests do let me know. I'm hoping to start those back up

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:35.800
I was um, ignoring about it because I'm like, why would I do tutorials for like a platform that is like, you know

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.400
Struggling and the answer there is like hey, I'm just gonna do it

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.560
I'm just gonna like I'm just gonna continue doing tutorials continue servicing that community and

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.680
Hey, if the platform continues to struggle, I don't care. It's my channel

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.280
News related question above did I miss a question?

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.000
See a question. Oh, there are thoughts on the red X file search. I have no idea what it is

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.480
Oh, I do. I just didn't know it was called that. Um

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.280
That is a searcher that searches through all public

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.640
Public folders that are been indexed by it actually uses good effects is like database as far as I'm aware

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.040
that has scanned through using the web API all of

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.920
All of the public folders that it's available for it cannot find your private content. It cannot steal your avatars

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.640
It's just scanning for public folders

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.040
If you happen to put something you don't intend to inside a public folder

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.760
Make sure you select it and hit that purple hand like on that will

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:36.280
Prevent it from being public. It removes it from public. Um, I like it. I built one myself

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.160
Shortly before I joined the Neos team when I joined the Neos team, I shut down mine. It still exists

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.120
I still have the code for it

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.260
I would love to release the code

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.560
but the problem releasing the code is that it basically tells you how to use the Neos API to do what I told like what

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.560
I'm telling you just to build that database and

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.840
I don't want to be liable is the wrong word, right?

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.200
Because I'm not doing anything wrong, but I don't want to be liable for support in

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.560
How that code works?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:09.640
Because of the state of the API so when I joined the Neos team, I was like, hey, it's much better if I spend more time

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.000
Making things in Neos. I want to make a reality such as the inbuilt

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.600
Item searcher exist rather than spending time on this item searcher

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.080
Which will inevitably just become a time sink for me when people look at it and go that's really cool

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.000
But can I make it do this and me have to go like oh, yeah sure you push XYZ

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.780
It'll do that. But yeah, I have I have one that is closed source right now. They exist. It's really cool

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:40.240
Like it's really really really really really cool. I just put a pause on it looking at tutorial quests someone

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.920
Someone was talking to me about those ones or froppy would like a tutorial on the forward note

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.160
Yeah, my vector mathematics is like exceptionally like

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.720
Strange in the once you start using it. You're like, oh, that's easy. Oh, why didn't I think of that?

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.920
So probably specific talking about the nodes such as forward up left right down

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.440
They're like vector based things. We need to do a sort of imagine a

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.920
Gizmo always being on your object. Let's say you have I don't know like a goose NPC, right?

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:17.200
That goose has a forward vector and then you can do master that forward vector and it's usually better than doing other

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.680
forms of mathematics a good example here is if you

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.760
if you have an object with a global position and we'll just call it the goose and

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.580
You set its position to its forward vector times a multiplier

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:39.000
And then add that onto its existing position. So you do it's an existing position plus its forward vector plus a multiplier

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.480
It will move forward at that multipliers

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.920
Interval, let's say it's for direct vector is straight towards

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.920
We'll just say the front of the world just to avoid the mathematics for right now and you do front and you do front times

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.180
Five it will move five units in the front of the world and it's beautiful

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:01.520
I you don't need to do any sort of mathematics to figure out all which direction am I which rotation of mine?

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.600
There's no trigonometry involved. It just does it. It's beautiful. So yeah, I'd love to draw on them

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.920
I'm

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:13.640
Moving forwards Oh Ruscio has asked for a 3d mass tutorial. I don't know if I want to expand into like actual education

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.080
I can I will have to put disclaimers at the bottom there though that I am NOT like

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.280
Educationally licensed. I don't know if I need to but I probably will like I can teach

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.360
I can teach things like a trigonometry or Pythagoras or stuff like that

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.260
I can teach like I said the forward vector etc stuff like that. I

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.900
I um, they just sort of they come into a sort of like weird thing

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:40.020
Like am I doing math tutorials for people who might not be news related or am I doing?

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.540
Tutorials for those who are in neo somewhat to use those mathematical concepts because I think there's a realm for both

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.060
There is also another question

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.960
I know this is meant to be about news and I tell people off without asking how I am and stuff but

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.800
I never quite know what to do with my youtube channel, right?

00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:02.620
My youtube channel is Neos tutorials Neos tutorials cool if mathematical tutorials that weren't associated with Neos or blender

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.940
Tutorials or VR chat tutorials or chill out VR tutorials started appearing on that channel. Is that okay?

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:14.340
I never know like I know that like bigger channels they like make multiple channels to host their like random stuff. You know, there's like

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:21.220
Big youtuber one and that's where all they're like really highly produced videos do and then they usually have like a big

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:27.340
Youtuber too and that's where they put like less effort he videos in and then they have big youtuber dash gaming

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.980
Which is where they just play games and stuff

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.140
That's like that's what I usually do, but I don't know if I want to do that

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.980
I remember replying to a tweet from Eastern Eastern tweeted like

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:45.380
something something, you know didn't want to post anything about non Neos content and that was strange because like Twitter is my space and

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.500
If you follow me on Twitter, you'll see I sometimes retweet random stuff

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.500
That doesn't make any sense and it's nothing to do in years, but that's my time. That's my timeline

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.280
Those are my tweets if you don't like them you can buzz off

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.060
So I think I should probably adopt that approach to my channel as well

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:02.860
I'll still keep it to like tutorials and learning and stuff like that. But hey if I wanted to do blender like

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.460
Or VR chat or whatever you might see stuff on there. I know people who asked for it

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.580
I just don't know how yeah chat works. Most of Avatar 3 is just like

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.780
So I'd have to go learn that and do that, but I think people would appreciate it

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.340
Anyway, that was another question to you. So let me jump through the other questions that we have here

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.820
So Lexus, do you think there'll be another competition similar to Neos Neos?

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:27.660
I think it was Neos create a contest not Neos contest contest, but totally fine, which will be officially run by the Neos team

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.920
In due course. Yes, read hashtag and

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.740
We will have the MMC

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.380
2023 which will be

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.460
Probably I don't know it's not announced yet, but it'll be sort of start of the year next year

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.860
So maybe February time again

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.440
I have no idea how MC 2023 is gonna be but now you've had that quick succession

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:53.300
Which was the October MMC and then the February MMC you can have have like a have a gap

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.060
Relax, no contests. However, you are free to have your own contest

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.540
If you want to set one up

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.940
I'll get to that in a moment, Lex. I'm sorry. I wrote that page. I wrote that page

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.660
I'll get to that. What I'm sorry to say is if you want to have your own contest and you can get sponsorship for it

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.700
Go for it. Don't feel obligated to you know, let us know or anything like that

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.220
Good example here being Festa. Festa has been running for like three years and to be honest

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.500
I still have hardly no idea who runs it what it's about etc. I just know it's cool. So cool do it

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.180
Do keep a look at

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.940
Look at like a good example here is to look at Altspace VR

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.780
If you go to Altspace VR, it's more of an event team platform. So you look at the event tab in the event tab

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.220
it's basically just like

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.220
anything from

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:48.020
live music to conversations about sort of philosophy and religion and stuff like that and there are events that you can just go to and

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.900
I know for a fact because I know how that team works that they don't know the events that happening on their platform

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.560
They do if there's you know, any sort of breaks and rolls or anything like that

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.620
But they're just like yeah, if you want to do it go for it

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:03.220
I bet you there's like a sort of underwater basket weaving event on what space VR and just it's great

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:08.700
So I'm saying there basically is more events equal good if you want to do another event do it. It'll be cool

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.340
Now moving forwards any tutorials about anim chase would rule. I

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.420
Actually don't know how an M. Shea works. That's what I reasons why we haven't had an MGA tutorial

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.260
I don't know how it works

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:23.220
I have to like look it up and the only reason I can know how it works is by doing that C sharp class thing

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:28.380
I mentioned because like cool there are a bunch of snippets like the one next provided like the one other people have provided

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.380
You know the JSON files where it's like here's how to do one thing

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.580
But it's kind of hard to talk about an MJ in isolation

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:39.060
There are lots of people making tools for it as well. But like if I was doing a tutorial for it in the interim

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.980
It would literally just be like a notepad document. We'd be typing it

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.700
Just like it's gonna be interesting

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.260
But it's basically like a tutorial for people who then want to make tooling for an MJ

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.260
I still think it's worthwhile. So it is on the list

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.500
Kip who says I joined late which node handles the vector math all the nodes

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.620
Plus minus divide times all can take float threes and they can do the vote the vector maps

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.700
The specific nodes that we were talking about

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.700
earlier though were

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.980
Forward backwards up down left right etc

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:14.060
And those ones are the ones that are very good if you know how to use them

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.980
They're a lot faster than sort of other ways of doing things like a vehicle really easy with the forward node. For example

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.340
Specs says they are very much in need of a hand pose a tutorial

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:31.620
Um, I don't know like a hand pose a component itself doesn't really have any sort of configuration options on it

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:37.540
That will allow you to sort of tweak like how tight the hand closes or how open the hand opens

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.900
There might be sitting on there on the VR I case other things if I was going to do a hand poses specifically tutorial

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:50.420
It would just be to how to like set up hands manually, which I think I already have but as for like different grip poses

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.420
I think it is. I think we have a yes

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.860
Yeah, I've issued about that one

00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:00.300
Then Lex points out that the NCC page on the news wiki says the news contest contest

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.060
Which is entirely my fault because I wrote that page

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:08.500
It was the news creator contest so he has created contest not the news contest contest

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.300
But hey, if you want to make the news contest contest and make it a mean go for it

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.320
I will update that page when I remember to

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.500
Spec says that they have an avatar with a few fingers and it was led

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.300
Led to the hand poser as a solution

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.060
You can have a look at the hand poser

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.480
What I would probably do first of all though is take a look at your rig

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.360
and

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:36.000
See what the hands look like in their t-pose state and my blender or whatever and then see if we can sort of figure out

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Anything from there?

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.960
There is a limited amount of stuff we can do in adjusting those

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:47.000
It's really finicky though like it's like manual mathematics on my each finger, and it's just yeah

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.000
Honestly just fiddling with it would be good. I would say that I can have a look but

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.980
That's why I would be doing I would just literally be fiddling with the numbers

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.680
Maybe get some pictures into questions and help see if anyone else has come up the issue

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.960
I'm not gonna say like hey go poke them because they might know because I don't know if they'll know

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.320
But like I have a vague memory that dorky might have had a similar problem with another avatars

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.000
They might know and let's get some pictures into

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.960
questions and help maybe someone can

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.200
See that and ask and get some help with that. I believe that we are out of questions

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.240
I hope you've enjoyed primetime as much as I have enjoyed primetime

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.000
Do you have any further questions feel free to ask them in the discord DM me send me pictures of cheese whatever you'd like

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:37.680
I will get back to you as soon as possible. I didn't upload. I forgot. I'm really bad at this. I'll get better

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.800
I promise I didn't upload the previous episode to sounder, but I'll put both episodes in sounder today and

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:51.760
Get those those in you in you get those in here. Well. I'm losing the ability to English right now

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.680
I

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:59.160
Get those into into this channel. Let me know how sound is going by the way. I know some people prefer like notes

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.160
I'm just trying to like save time right now I

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.960
Had more time I could type up notes if you want to type up notes based on the recording go for it

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:14.080
I'm just like it became really time wasting if I like time wasting because it is good time. What's the word time intensive?

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.680
To do the notes in the old way

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.760
And at one point I had like three recordings. I had to go through and like type notes for them

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.760
They got like this is like four hours of me. Just listening to my own voice. This is horrible. Please stop

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.880
So that's why I went to the different approach which meant like hey at least the recordings there

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.880
They're also some complaints that the

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.600
Notes didn't reflect accurately what I said and the reason there was because I was summarizing right in the in the written notes

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.320
I was basically like for spec this question for example

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:43.640
I'd be like posting questions or not there's the notes and people like well. It's not what you said. It's like well

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:51.360
It's the action item about why I said the action item was posting questions and help about it the fact that I meandered for like

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.880
Three minutes talking about the hand poser is inconsequential it doesn't really fix the problem, but but there you go windows

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.960
Hey, I'm not doing windows. H should do windows key G though

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.640
That's the game bar game bars cool used to stream to mixer then they had to pull that code out anyway

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:14.720
I'll leave you here guys any other questions. Let me know I will get back to you as soon as I can bye. Bye
