00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
All right everyone welcome to prime time the office hours stroke am a or prime man whatever questions

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.760
You might have for me, please thrill free to drop the questions in the office hours chat, and I'll get to them as soon as I can

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.520
With there being no questions in place right now

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.560
just a quick reminder to everyone to continue reading our roadmap reading the Neos wiki for the contact in the news team page and

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.200
Playing yes. I am a fun quiet bunch today

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.300
I mean if you have any questions any questions at all drop them in the office hours chat. I'll be happy to answer them

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.080
That's why you're all here. You have no questions. That's totally fine, too

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.200
But we're just gonna sit here in silence, so I'm making awkward. Oh the most amazing amazing sentence someone has a question

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.960
I'm amazed please please delight me with your question. I can't wait to answer it

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.200
Okay, so we have a question from bad. This is a good question

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.720
So thank you for asking it that says is there any plan for account management as in changing usernames or emails and such?

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.000
Right now lots of that stuff goes through shifty

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.480
She's amazing at her job and helping people out, but I would love for that to be automated

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.480
That will go into a lot of what will happen with like the website, so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.260
If you visit like the author on the ice calm you'll see the sort of new

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.860
A website framework, that's not what it'll look like that's just sort of like a technicality thing as a technical thing

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.660
There's a lot of new endpoints and authorization there

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.420
That will allow things like

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.500
Changing username email and stuff like that

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.220
Those would be most of the website features that you you know find on many other web providers

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.980
I'd also like to see if we can get those abilities in the actual game from of them being in the actual game sometimes this

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.080
Processes are a little bit complicated and so when I usually do them on a website because it's easier, but

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.520
We'll see what we can do. Honestly though being yes

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.480
I would I would love it if shifty's primary job throughout the day was not

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.960
Doing stuff which could easily be automatable by a screen

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.720
I'm happy that she does it for us, but it would be great if you know she didn't do same goes for patreon

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.720
I want like automated patreon linkage

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.520
That'll be interesting because we need would basically need you to do is link your account met like you know how right now

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.840
Yeah, like it'll link automatically of the emails match

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.920
If emails don't match you have to like speak to shifty etc. It'll be like instead login to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.240
patreon and allow

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.920
Like login to Neos allow

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.320
Neos to access your patreon data, and it'll be able to see that you have a pledge to it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.120
And I'll be able to link those together

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.880
I strangely have the sort of policy of always trying to make myself redundant when it comes to any sort of process that I don't

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.120
Think I should do you know when you think about like vacuuming you're like oh

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.080
can I automate vacuum cleaning and that's how things like Roombas came up and they haven't yet found a Roomba that doesn't eat my

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.840
Socks, so I don't like this okay. We have some new questions, but a little bit about the Roomba first of all

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.920
Yeah, I agree like half the cleaning power of a Roomba is just making you pick up stuff like I I used to use a Roomba

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.040
I wouldn't turn it on as much as I would like because I had to babysit it

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.200
It could never do like a full cleaning job and even when it could I didn't think it was doing a good job

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.280
So I purchased a regular vacuum cleaner, and I pushed the vacuum cleaner around my apartment. How he would do it normally and manually and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.640
It collected like way more dust and then I thought it should have and so I just haven't used it

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.960
I don't think it's effective. It might be on like an exceptionally clean house

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.300
But like it's like three pairs of slippers like in my like living room, and I don't really know why and there's a sock over there

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.640
I don't know how long that's been there. You know you got a tidy up. It's crazy

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.580
I bought a second pair because I needed to launder my first pair

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.860
But then I realized my first pad couldn't be laundered. It's not like like they're fluffy insides, right?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.020
But I wanted to clean the fluffy insides, and I had I clean the fluffy insides

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.340
And it's like maybe just throw it in the laundry no you can't do that

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.340
So I specifically bought a new pair of slippers

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.140
Could be thrown in the laundry obviously by itself you wouldn't put it in with a full load of laundry

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.140
Excuse me. You wouldn't throw it in with a full load of laundry, but like you

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.900
You just put them in separately

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.260
As for the actual questions, sorry getting back on topic here. Ruscio asks

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.940
I have a question about the WebSocket text message sender node

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.700
node not note if the WebSocket client component has a separate user than user responsible for the impulse that is received at the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.220
WebSocket text message sender node does the event get networked back to the other user as a rejected outright

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.580
I have opened up the code base to take a look at that, and I'll also take a look at

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.580
the

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.740
Follow-up question there, which is

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.580
Can I localize the WebSocket client component or would that not be advisable?

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.300
I'm go ahead and open up the WebSocket client component first and just sort of take a look at the I pushed the wrong thing

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.100
Control no, I don't run Neos. Stop. Stop. Don't run. Oh, it's just building. That's fine

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.020
WebSocket client here is a component as the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.700
Handling user property here. Handling user is null. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.220
Text message received dot invoke

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.820
Okay, so that would be the Web

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.340
Text WebSocket text message receiver here

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.300
client text message

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.500
received there is no network synchronization of the event so should only be from the user which the

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.580
The WebSocket is done by basically we only open up the connection on the

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.660
on the user that is in the

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.940
Handling user so that's good there

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.580
Now you could by the looks of things you could

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.460
You could values override or localize in whatever way you want to the the component

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.340
The only issue there is that you would have to localize as effectively as you can

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.500
I don't know how effectively to do this across the board all of the properties. So there's URI

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.620
access reason and connect retry interval

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.380
Those all sync as in the value of those sync. And so if those all aren't localized then you'll have a problem same with the is

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.580
connected

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.020
Those are all syncs. You'll basically have to like localize the entire thing

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.140
As it only connects to the handling user

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.820
It might be better to just like make you know, say there's four users make four copies of that component on a slot

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.700
So four slots and use and use that right?

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.740
There'll be no overhead from doing that because it's only connecting on the user that is in the handling user property

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.740
See what happens if the handling user is null

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.420
Connect to references

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.020
It's helping out here, thanks. Oh, cool.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.660
Connecting user not equal to local user

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:44.260
Parallels not. Yeah, should be good. Just make a yeah make four if there's four people etc

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:51.660
So Gun Griffin then asks does the bhaptics port open automatically or does it require enable? It opens up automatically

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.780
Make sure that the bhaptics software, the bhaptics player

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.380
has like a green status and that you've tested it if it's your first time and then it should just run it a little

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.380
bit like the

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.940
VIVE face tracker. I know the face tracker like when we initialize it we actually like will

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.060
Cause the the software to run which I think is quite cool, but I found that would be haptics better to run the software first

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:21.660
Particularly because you know putting it on is an activity. So I put it on and then I make sure it's okay and then I

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:28.340
I will then start Neos. With the face tracker like it's easy to start Neos with the headset on your head like the

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.340
Vhaptics vest is a conscious decision. In fact all the Vhaptics stuff is it's like let's shoot up and get it

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.260
All right, I think we're up to date on questions. So if you have any other further questions keep them coming

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.540
It's pretty quiet one today, but I'll still upload the recording. I'll try and trim the silence though

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.260
It's also awesome to see when you trim the silence how much time is actually spent on the office hours

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.660
We're sitting here for 30 minutes. That's the time but maybe once we've trimmed the silence

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.180
It's actually 22 minutes and that means who I've saved listeners eight minutes by trimming the silence from my recording

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.780
Rafi I see you type in I'm expecting good things. Ah, we already answered that one

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.340
I'm not sure if you're here when we did. Thank you for Rafi

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.340
Rafi was asking if I had answered a previously asked question and I did no worries

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.780
We all need more sleep these days. So wait for another question. I had checked my emails

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.460
I know this is nothing to do with you, but I have zero emails. I have no

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.260
I'm ecstatic that that is the case. Oh, I just dropped

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.300
Yes

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.640
Anyway when you question from sorta super who says a question

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.540
with all the tools for geometry creation in here

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:41.900
So their plans to implement a material remover of some form or eraser would be wonderful when creating rough drafts of an FBX to export

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.500
More mesh editing tools are on our roadmap

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:50.060
I'm not quite sure what like sort of form they'll take something that comes up. A lot is

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.960
Terrain generation of the sort of brush kind, you know, and you can sort of like go

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.580
Hey this area higher this area lower and also sort of carve through the terrain a little bit

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.740
That'll be cool

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:07.220
The tooling there could also probably used for like an eraser when you're using the pen like, you know

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.980
When you use the the tube pen

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.820
Which is most pens that you use they're just they don't look like tubes because the the dots been trunk small

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.660
It would allow you to do an eraser there

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.740
You can kind of do that right now, but that's only if you sort of write in a very specific way

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.740
You'll be able to just erase portions of it

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.180
We have the mesh editing tools. You might be able to erase it like it was an actual, you know pencil on paper

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.980
Let's say you draw. I don't know like let's say

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:37.500
H you might be able to just like erase half the H because you put the eraser tool through half the H

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:43.820
Thank you properly linked the topic shoes for those if you want to like see what might be possible

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.340
go back through Frixus's Frixus's

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.100
YouTube channel and

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.340
You'll see that there is a

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.720
Video, I don't know what's called. I think it's water water clean is or something like that

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:04.860
It's an earlier version of Neos that was mostly sort of a tech demo for the leap motion that had terrain generation in it

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.580
And Griffin is asking for a could we get a separate by loose parts option?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:18.580
Depends like how that would work. I'd have to look entirely like how the mesh is converted. There's a concept in in

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:25.220
Assimp yeah, okay. It was out of the way, which is what's called sub meshes also exists in the file formats

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.860
We use etc. It just sort of refers to like how a mesh is bucketed down

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.100
Separate by loose parts in blender does it by

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:40.940
Its internal format as other applications, and that's more sort of like you know if it can see that those vertices are separated

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.340
I'm just not sure like like if the data structure is there that we can use. It's certainly a good idea

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.620
So hop it over to the github

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:54.940
It's not already there and do double check the static mesh ready because there are a bunch of options there one might function

00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:00.840
Close enough like split sub meshes. I thought that was an option which reminds me if you're building stuff in blender

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.420
Please rename your objects and make them make sense

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:10.220
I'm so tired of downloading new avatars or new models and open them in blender and like the model is just called like

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.300
Cylinder it's like great

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.300
So you made this fantastic avatar?

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:22.060
Which I just paid 20 bucks for and you couldn't be bothered to rename the cylinder to body which is anything other than just

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.220
Cylinder cube or box or whatever same with hard surface modeling as well

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.100
It's so much easier to navigate through let's say. I don't know it's a

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.340
architectural piece and

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.980
You know I let's say it's a you know conference room

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:44.380
That's an always an easy example like the wall object is called box 22 and the floor is called box 50

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.140
There's no rhyme or reason there. You know what it is because you're just clicking it just

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.660
It'll be really easy inside

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:56.060
Neos to figure out what if you want to delete or move the walls of the floor and it reminds me of them some shoes

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.220
So I don't want to harp too much on sort of you know

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.260
People who are not as familiar with the tools that they're using as possible, but I do occasionally find

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:11.660
Usually more sort of like anime starred models where they've got shoes, and they're wearing a particular type of shoes and the reason

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:17.540
They're wearing those shoes because that's the customization they wanted. That's the identity they wanted they wanted those cool shoes

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.620
That's fantastic you you've decided the pair of shoes that you want

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:26.540
but then you went ahead and you downloaded an architecturally correct or anatomically correct shoe model and

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.020
Brought that into your avatar, and then just glued it to the bone

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.980
At that point you have like an a million

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.380
polygon shoe

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:41.700
And you go down and I've done this a few times you go down and you realize each individual eyelet for the laceless

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.460
That's the the hole what the laces go through on the side of the lacing area of the shoe is

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:52.620
Is like 20 20 K tries itself because it was meant to be a sort of close-up

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:59.700
rendering model for maybe sort of promotional renders of the shoe or to show off the shoe as like a skill of

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:07.500
3d modelism 3d model realism it does feel like I'm griffin says polygon ballast that it does feel like that sometimes

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.260
it makes perfect sense like if you're doing sort of like a promotional model for a shoe or

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.980
You're testing rendering rather than gameplay design

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.580
You render that shoe as many triangles as you want like it's just it's gonna render and it's gonna look cool

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.940
And you're gonna get the effect that you want if you're putting that onto an avatar though need to use different

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.860
Models different materials it also happened once with I think it was like a wedding ring or something

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.500
but you know that was like a VR chat wedding and

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.360
Someone was like could you put like a wedding ring on my avatar for me?

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.740
And I'm like sure send me the unity package I can sort that out and open it up and then I open up the ring

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.740
They wanted on there and again. It was like in a million

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:51.140
Polygon ring I said you realize you're gonna see like 0% of this yeah, but it looks cool and some okay

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.180
Let me try and decimate it so I decimated it down and I sent it to them

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.700
And they're like it doesn't look as cool now

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:02.340
It's gonna be like a pixel or two on most people's screens, and if you're close up

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:08.460
It's still only gonna be like a tiny square. Yes. That is a perfect representation of the problem

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:14.340
Imagine that a wedding ring or the eyelet of a shoelace. I do have a lot of architectural models as well

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.340
Those are interesting because those are made in

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.100
architectural modeling applications, they're more designed to be

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.620
True to the word what you actually need to build at the building from that

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.140
Maybe it will output blueprints

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.380
You know that the the foreman for a project will actually look at and build something for

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.780
And so the the model format comes out not that optimized for Neos

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:43.760
But the reason why it's not optimized is because it's like extreme detail and this isn't even really in polygons

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.100
It's in sort of like all the sort of like gubbins

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.700
Just if you're in a building

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.540
That's an apartment block like I am walking your stairwell and just like look at everything

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.020
I look at the way that like the stairs above you look the stairs below you look

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:03.220
I just like the handrails how they're affixed right because it's an architectural model. They've modeled all of that

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:08.460
And it's just like ah well. It was cool once we were doing a sort of walkthrough of something

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.460
we based on one of those models and

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.820
The person that was looking at it was like be great if the curtains were open

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:22.060
And I just shot one curtain with a mesh visibility tip because I had a feeling and that feeling was correct

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.260
Which was every single curtain was its own object within Neos

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.460
and so I shot the curtains with the mesh visibility tip one curtain and

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:36.580
The curtains throughout the entire building just vanished, and it was beautiful. They're just like that was quick

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:41.500
This is really cool, and it like you know showed the power of them sort of using it as a tool for visualization

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:48.580
But I was also scared because if I shot the wrong thing half the building would disappear like if you shoot

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:54.860
generic white wall it might take out like all of the walls because they're all sort of linked together because they want to export the

00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:01.020
Mesh into like blueprint layers where it's like you know put up drywall here concrete here stuff like that

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.460
I think I just explained the odd interactions

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:09.700
Yoho asked about the odd interactions with those architecturally thingies. Lux has a question which looks to be interesting

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.140
So go ahead and read it out for the recording

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:17.780
I have a rather more abstract involved question about data types and inheritance is there a plan to add detailed documentation about how data types

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.380
Actually inherit properties from one another on the wiki for a contrived example

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.940
I know I collider is probably interface for box collider mesh collider, etc

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:31.300
So with this knowledge I could presumably store just an I collide a data type and store of the derived types into it

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.340
It would help to get a more general sense of how all the different types fit together

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.140
The answer is yes, but only to an extent there is some

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.700
Occurrences, I'm gonna see you so I'm gonna sneeze or is it a sneeze it's gonna disappear. It's it's disappearing okay um

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:50.380
Damn it. I wanted to sneeze um there are some occurrences in that area where you guys are going too detailed

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:59.580
If you're using like sync sync ref field ref you're usually doing really advanced stuff, and I always worry about that

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.860
I'm like how can we make that easier for you to do?

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:10.940
Because you shouldn't have to understand the entire sort of object orientated hierarchy of Neos to build something inside Neos

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:17.260
Collider is a good example of a case where you probably should but additionally I would probably want to

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.900
Like abstract the whole I collider concept into just a collider data type that

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:30.140
Transparently told you what was going on, but also made easier for people that didn't understand what an interface was programmatically

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.100
What I mean by that is like if you pull away all the layers you're basically dealing with raw C-sharp types

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.100
But should you have to?

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.740
Regardless of that though there will be documentation on that in the future

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.700
And they'll also be tooling like I just said to make those sort of easier processes for you

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.300
I see some people are just like if I put this like incredibly weird

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:55.260
I know you sometimes have to put weird symbols in various components, but they're like incredibly weird symbols in a component

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.900
I can do all these crazy things, and I'm just like that's actually a feature request in disguise

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.220
There's no way you should have to do all of that craziness just to get that effect

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.220
So yoho if you have a question locks if your question, that's good

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.620
Otherwise I want to cut it there as we are nearing the half hour so please go for some paper

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.620
If you have a question if not whatever

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.380
You have the opportunity

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.040
You know I wanted to see the April 1st badges for me

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.580
I couldn't get into a session with the limited time I had on yes that day to see them as I am a developer I

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.700
Can actually just turn on April Fools mode?

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.860
Myself and then run the game, so I'll go ahead and do that and get a picture when I get

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:39.700
Oh, it's otherwise. I think that's it so I will speak to you guys next week look for this to be up on the wiki

00:18:39.700 --> 00:19:04.700
Etc later, and I'll get back to you soon. Bye
