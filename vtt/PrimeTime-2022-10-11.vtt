WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
All right, so we'll get started it is primetime the office hours AMA segment where I answer your questions and

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.580
We'll get started do any questions that appear last questions are

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:18.700
Not here. I will just sit in unimaginable endless silence whilst I check tracking for a parcel that is going all the way to Tasmania.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.080
Really? I got that check information off to the Lord bucket head says how has my day been so far?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.560
I really also like personal questions, but since questions are kind of dry. I'll go for it. Oh, yeah good

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.040
I have a giant mug of tea, but I'm gonna go ahead and and chug and

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.880
On the rest of my day. I guess anyway um

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.040
after office hours at least

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.700
Moving forwards to unnamed cyborg cat who says is Neos ever going to be finished yet

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.640
I don't think Neos will ever ever be finished

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280
unlike games which are

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.920
Like real games like Neos is is always going to be ever-growing

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
Once we get through all this stuff

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520
Let's think of an example here

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.280
I take the the latest Legend of Zelda game right that has a defined start point and end point and yeah

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.420
There could be DLC of course that could be DLC

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.800
But there is a defined start and end point where that game will just not require any additional work whereas we have a metaverse

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.560
that's going to need additional work until the end of its existence as a reminder for those who have just joined or run away please drop

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.800
questions in the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.640
Thread that we have up in the office hours text chat. I'll answer them in the order that they appear

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.040
If there are no questions, I will sit here in silence until

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.000
Questions appear just the nature of office hours

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.080
Whilst I wait for questions. I'm gonna go ahead and push another couple of buttons to make sure that a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800
parcel appears at

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.120
my house

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.520
Scheduled package, please arrive today. Excellent. Oh

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.480
We have a question from Risa. Thank you Risa says another cjism

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.280
We've been having more world performance issues namely the lockups

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.480
We feel when avatars load in what we've noticed is that saving allowing the world to reload often clears this up when the same number

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.960
Of users are present in the world as typically buyers a few hours

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.080
Before we need to save and reload again any thoughts on what we could be causing the performance to degrade over time until they restart

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.080
Um

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.480
Potentially unused assets have you like does the cg worlds have the cleanup unused assets checkbox enabled on their sessions?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.040
That that might help that's really the only thing I can think of that would be like people loading in and loading out

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920
They do. Okay. Yeah

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.480
interesting to sort of monitor that I guess

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.640
My public folder somewhere. There's like the world health thing

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.320
I wanted to make it like a huge thing in the end. I just had two accounts the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.760
Direct children of the roots law and the direct children of the assets law and and seeing if that goes

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.040
Up and down throughout the session might be a sort of indicator if cleanup unused assets is working

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.800
And then I don't really have any other ideas unfortunately right now. We have two additional questions here from Marcus

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.100
Thank you for this first question. Why do you like news? I don't actually know

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.400
I know that like, you know a team member should have like a really good answer here. That's like

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.040
Businessy and like, you know, if it's the like energy of the company

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.680
but I don't I

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
Like it. I don't know why

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520
Yeah

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.560
Sorry, I'll get a words on that one. Oh

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.360
Then the second question is what would be some things to say to someone to try to get them to check out

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.360
Neos with me

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.240
Firstly make sure you're not

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.560
Guess like bullying is the wrong word nagging nagging would be a good word

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.520
Make sure that nagging them like some people are just happy what they're what they're doing

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.520
You know, they're happy in there. There are applications and they're happy

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Not having a you know, boiling screen strapped to their face. So do keep that in mind

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.760
Don't don't pester people if they've said no a few times anyway, um

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.800
without the way

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.040
The focus on what you can do but also what you can experience a lot of times

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.760
I see players focusing on what you can do and that's where a session might turn into sort of like Gary's mod style session

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.520
And to that point you can do Gary's mod style stuff on Gary's mod

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.480
You can also do Gary's mod style stuff on many many games. For example, if just playing around with guns go play h3vr

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.720
if it's just

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.840
Goofing off then Gary's mod, even VRChat covers that rate show them what is unique about Neos

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.720
Take them on a world tour show them the community and how helpful they are

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.760
Also, try not to make their first session as about avatars as like it needs to be

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.360
Because they want to feel comfortable in their avatar

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.720
But like maybe suggest

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.840
Using one of the already uploaded avatars so they can get a feel of the game before they spend like four hours uploading their avatar

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.640
The first time because it will take them a while. Um, that's worked quite well for some people

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.400
I think it was like a friend once who resolved

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.920
I don't know

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.680
They were the first person I saw that idea from they came in to sort of see what Neos is about

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.760
And I sort of asked them if I wanted, you know, they wanted help him point in their VRChat avatar

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.000
And they went you know what? No, just just give me an avatar

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.340
That's like close enough to the avatar and show me what this can do

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.020
I'll worry about my avatar later and I really appreciated that sort of perspective on how they wanted to play the

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.460
Play Neos because it means that they didn't

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.540
They didn't spend their first session like EDP and inspectors. They fit the first session

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.620
Learning what we had to offer in the event that they have their avatar created and updated and stuff like that

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.260
It gave them more reason than later to get their avatar in

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.300
Lex's question here, which is I've noticed more frequently in the past months

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.260
The S variant servers either get stuck or stop entirely with no indication of uses

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.740
Except for broken textures and shaders. What would be a good way to find these specific users to notify the team?

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.620
Um, we have pretty good notification on that one from the QC team

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:11.460
More is always welcome. Of course. I am actually starting to mean that a little bit with a days since asset server

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.380
whole

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.700
Image, which I'm gonna get set up somewhere

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.300
but

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.300
You can usually see it in

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.220
in the logs as a failure on a particular like

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.540
On a particular gather job usually for like new shader files or something like that if they can't be got

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.580
Then then that's usually the problem if you see an increase in things turning pink randomly. That's also an indicator for

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.700
That happening as well

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.500
Yeah, C's link has got it. I get kind of annoyed about that one. Obviously we're a little bit stuck because we can't you know

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.300
do much about that, but

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.700
I

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.700
want to like

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.580
There's like

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.060
There's a whole class of like computing and engineering that happens at like big companies called observability

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:07.140
So observability is a little bit different than development observability just means sort of like what is happening?

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.540
What is happening?

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.940
And so large companies large corporations

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.740
They invest a lot in observability just so that they can see stuff and this actually goes like sort of beyond or tangential to data

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.500
Science where it's like, okay what data insights can we get about our users? This is basically just like what is happening?

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.760
Show me what's happening. And so getting more observability on the asset process

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.520
Processing for the team will allow us to do stuff like that. Now. I have worked for many corporations

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.220
Where you know if stuff goes wrong someone gets a phone call. I don't think we need that

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.140
Um, but we do need somewhere that like alerts us to it. I

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.700
mean probably a

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.860
But you know, like we'll see what we can do. Um

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:59.220
I'm not quite sure why that keeps happening, but it's about once a month and it bothers me. It bothers me. Um

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.420
Let's move onwards

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:10.860
A follow-up is a plan to move asset variation generation and uploads back to the client at some point. Clients do do some of it

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.940
But that's certainly an option that we wanted to look at

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.780
We also want to look at sort of more peer-to-peer style things and people get sort of like worried or concerned when I say that

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.500
but it's basically just like

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.140
hmm a

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:31.700
Friend of yours which happens to live like the next town over has the assets for this particular session

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:38.180
Maybe they can give them to you rather than you going to a server that's on the other side of the country. Maybe

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.620
just say

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.100
So that would also help in that regard because what that would mean is like hey

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:51.820
Maybe the asset variant like server doesn't have that particular thing all up-to-date, but hey, maybe someone in the world does

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.580
Windows Defender took action on threats. What's good on Windows Defender? What did you find?

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.660
Oh, Windows Defender is telling me that my hosts file has a lot of entries in it that it finds suspicious

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.300
Yeah, I think so and does be blocking all the track as you have is is that's totally sus

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.780
Thanks for letting me know windows

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.460
It's like you put stuff on your host file of my yeah, that's what it's for

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.020
All right. I'm not seeing any more questions

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.900
Ozi asks, what is a funny near Smith you see going around recently?

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.420
I think I actually edited the myth page out of sort of like anger the other day. Let me go see what I what?

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.420
I added but look at the history

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.460
Yes, yes

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:39.180
Apparently Neos is an airline in Italy. Yeah, I don't remember making that issue

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.780
This one is referring to

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.900
So like there are a couple that keep that keep coming up recently one is that Neos isn't multi-threaded to that

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:52.220
I say go to your debug screen and just play Neos without open. You'll see background worker threads. You'll see background threads

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.540
You'll see all sorts. Lots of stuff is multi-threaded. Another one is the

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.660
If you're in a session Neos users can access your hard drive. The answer is no they can't

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.620
So great, thank you for spreading that rumor

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.940
We keep getting

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.180
Let's just say the you know, the crypto community keep coming in and they keep saying is this project dead

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.340
It's like ha well

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:23.260
like one of the team member is like here every single week for half an hour talking to you guys and then on

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:30.580
Wednesdays and on Fridays we have the streams and then like hey those moderators that we've got

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.500
They've been burning those capture bots all the time

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.140
If it was dead

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.260
this place would just be a wasteland would be covered in capture bots and family servers and

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.700
weird OnlyFans advertisements and fake Elon Musk's I

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.780
I have seen so many fake Elon Musk's like they're all over like YouTube shorts tik-tok YouTube reddit

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.900
It's basically just like them deep faking sometimes good sometimes bad

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.100
deep fakes of Elon going like buy this crypto currency

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.700
Crazy anyway, yeah, so if it was dead, I wouldn't be here talking about Elon Musk deep fakes

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.460
other ones that come with like the sort of like

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:13.420
Weirdness in some of our features being similar to features and other platforms

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.820
For example, people assume dynamic bones on Neos is the same as dynamic bones elsewhere. It is not

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.540
It's our own

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.660
Own implementation, which means that for Neos, it's it's better

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.580
Like I'm not gonna say it's like better than fizz bones or better than the original dynamic bones. That's not for me to qualify

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.860
It's better for Neos because we own it. We don't have to pay anyone for it

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:41.460
It is compatible with all our stuff and it will get any improvements that we make to Neos because of that

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.300
Additionally like nothing else on Neos

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.940
That you use as a feature needs to be paid for like you only pay for storage

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.300
And yeah, there's the end this client and stuff like that

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:59.340
But like you want to build like an you want to build the next Legend of Zelda and Neos there is nothing

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.140
But like there is nothing you need to pay for

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:08.700
Provided it stays under one gigabyte. Yeah, you know, I mean there are no features

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.020
moving forwards to

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.840
Exos what's the recommended amount of dedicated WAM I have the server we have

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:25.860
recommended system specs listed on the steam page for the steam for like the the head head full

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:32.980
I'll see opposite of headless heady the one with the head non headless

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.980
What is the opposite of headless

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.060
head

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.460
containing a head anyway for that we have that on the steam store page and

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.300
for

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.580
For headless there's lots of conversation in the headless client

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:54.420
I don't think we provided any official recommendations there simply because the headless client is still in air quotes

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.380
in

00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.880
Testing you're sitting on an early access game in beta. So like, you know, everything's in testing. But yeah

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:07.400
Foxbox asks when is a good time to clear your cash other than windows thing if you're out of storage because Neos has 150 gigabyte

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.400
Yeah, that just happened today for me

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.380
unlike I

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.540
Mean some of you might be like this. I'm like you though

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.620
I've got like four versions of Neos that run on my computer. So they've all got varying degrees of

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:24.940
Cash stored on them, which is is cool. So I need to go through and do that. Um,

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.860
A schedule might make sense, which is what the V T

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.300
Oxalis says, um, I don't think a schedule makes sense

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.380
Maybe another does I kind of do it based on?

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.380
Sort of like who I'm interacting with as an example. I haven't been to create a jams in a couple of weeks

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.660
That's not because I don't want to go to create a jams. I just haven't had the chance

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:54.180
So I probably have a lot of creative jammy stuff in my cache that I can clean out. That's it like

00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:01.140
Small example, but it might be like a you know, a bigger example that might be useful. I guess might be

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:07.740
Let's say VBL FC happens again, right? So you go to VBL FC that means that you've got the entirety of the VBL FC

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
convention center hotel

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:16.460
Rooms in your cache and then anyone that attends you've got in your cache and then after VBL FC

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.340
You go back to your private world to work on your custom inspector or multi-tool. You don't need

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.180
VBL FC in your cache anymore. So you might want to clear out at that point

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:30.260
Git asks or inspired using threads for office hours and do you find that helped out?

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.020
That would be

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.780
Eastern came up with the idea and I think it helps simply because when I'm

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.420
Updating notes or taking a look at what I did for the episode description over on sounder

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:50.020
Sometimes I am delayed on that simply through having a busy life and then I have to scroll up through Canadian Git's office hours

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:55.540
Or moderation's office hours or scroll around a little bit with it being in a thread. It just keeps everything contained

00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.740
I also find that it prevents spam in some cases because it's like focused

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.860
I think it's working for like containerizing them

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.740
Probably not needed but it works

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.260
Like says how would you be able to tell what was right for cash? Would you just leave stuff based on time? Yeah stuff based on time

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.140
Good example might again be you know, or parallel might be the junk drawer in your house

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.180
You know, if you haven't sorted out your junk drawer in about five years, you have no idea what's in it

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.180
Okay, so I think that's a good example

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.420
You know, if you haven't sorted out your junk drawer in about five years, you have no idea what's in it. Okay, so out your junk drawer

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.700
so when I get this like

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:41.740
Jaw surgery project finally finished I'll be clearing out my cash because it will have basically

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:47.100
Way more models of teeth and bones and jaws and skulls in it than I need

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.780
And I want to spend as little time as possible thinking about my teeth is you know

00:15:52.780 --> 00:16:00.340
For those who are not practicing good dental hygiene, I'm not judging here. I'm just saying like you should brush twice a day

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.340
Juries out on flossing from my point. I actually ended up reading scientific papers on flossing

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.620
You know flossing is kind of a little bit silly when you go to the dentist or the dentist is like wow

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.780
I could tell you've been flossing and I'm like, yep

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.060
Yeah, totally in the back of my head. I'm like I have a single time at all

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:26.140
No, but you mileage me very because I have literally the world's most expensive toothbrush. I have the most expensive Phillips toothbrush

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.940
Yeah

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.740
Remember when I bought it, but I do I don't know how we got to teeth. Oh, yeah the dental stuff

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.180
Yeah, I don't really want like think about my teeth teeth were expensive, etc. Etc

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.780
Preference like what teeth are expensive. Yeah, if you start having dental issues then

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:48.980
You'll find out how expensive teeth are the best way to delete your cash, which is a question from fox box

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.060
Which is you know, is there a best way to go about clearing your cash is to follow the guide?

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.500
I wrote that says how to clear your cash

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:58.820
Uh moving back up to Marco's question. He says do you have any favorite worlds or worlds?

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:06.140
I really like the time and gears. I've been to time and gears like randomly some because it's like it's it's cool. They're

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:13.460
It's cool. They're all in the wall is like usually my go-to well to just like sit when I'm like half paying attention

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:21.580
To existing I really do like sort of experience your art worlds. I'm less

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.020
it's not to say that these are good, but like I'm less bothered by

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:32.140
Like the chill out was that you see basically if your world has string lights and lots of cushions

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:40.060
Then your world is probably fantastic and very beautiful. But like it just has nothing for me. It's like, you know the 12th or 13th

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
string light and cushy cushion world that I've seen so

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.540
You know

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.060
That's why our hole in the wall gets like that. They're also like 72 grooved late, right?

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.020
It's it's it's still a hangout world, but it's not got string lights or cushions

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.860
So we both actually do have cushions, but like it's a it's a theming thing. I

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.820
Don't know like the words for architecture. The one I do know is brutalism, which I quite like

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.820
for my own weird taste, but

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:15.260
The all of the chat was in the archer and being brought over they all are the similar architecture

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:20.740
I don't know the name for that, but they all are that exact architecture. There's this really word

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:26.340
Well, I can't remember the name of actually I'm gonna go find the name. So those that play yeah, I can go find it

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.860
I know the weirdest like you have any favorite worlds away. Here's a VR channel. This is just an example right of

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.700
Where our tastes might differ very favorite worlds

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.180
Trying to find it

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.340
Favorite world. Yeah. No

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:53.140
Okay, the the thumb the fails are loading on the on the website and it says like world is currently available

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:59.820
Unavailable on like basically half of them. So I'll give up on that list. Oh, no. No, I found it. I found it

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:09.660
So there's a world here called FF CR which is like again by a hangout world over there but

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.340
It's really weird

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:18.260
And I feel like there's a story to it. So there's art to it as well. So like I like that

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:23.260
no one will hang out with me it so sometimes I'm just there by myself, but I

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.580
Guess that was sort of a play on I like walls which I'll hang out

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:33.060
But but but maybe consider being a bit different than than the usual one. I'll move on to questions before I continue to ramble

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.260
Yeah

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:41.740
Alexa I'm surprised anyone's in it. Yeah, I was like there's a story here. Like there's there's like a narrative

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.580
I'm gonna spoil too much but like explore and you'll see lots of stuff. That doesn't make sense

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.580
there's also lots of

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.620
Buttons and stuff that I can't really like figure out and

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.820
Sort of like weird

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.600
Anyway for example of brutalism by the way desert meeting space which now is a 2021 version

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:09.900
Thanks to soap who found out that there was actually a skyline geometry for that world. I just lost

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.460
So do check out desert meeting space 2021

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.100
I up the brightening the lighting so it's not just yellow now and looks better

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.780
Marco has a question here, which is do you have any tips?

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:27.220
So people just can't find motivation to brush their teeth or really do any hygiene stuff. Oh, okay

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.280
Daddy daddy prime is now giving people life tips

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.140
The strange one for brushing your teeth that I have is get out of the bathroom, right?

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.500
Of course, I like I leave my toothbrush in the bathroom, but I don't brush my teeth in the bathroom

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.740
ah, that's already a title that many people have given me and I don't want it but

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.220
Most people have issues with

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:54.220
Brushing their teeth because of the sort of loss of time of doing other stuff and I'm like cool

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.220
Well get yourself some wireless headphones

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.820
Go in the bathroom grab a toothbrush

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:04.900
Grab the toothpaste shove it on the brush start brushing come back to your computer and watch your funny cat memes on

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.340
On your TV or whatever. You don't need to be in the bathroom to brush your teeth

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.420
You just need to be in the bathroom to I guess spit out the toothpaste and rinse your mouth out

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.420
That's all you really need

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:24.300
Also for inexplicable reasons due to that my toothbrush often ends up on my computer desk, so that's it

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.660
That's a good reminder

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.660
Then there's habits as well

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:34.060
Like here's what I'm trying to break right now, which is kind of difficult which is when you're alone when your alarm goes off

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.020
What's the first thing you do? Do you grab your phone because that's like

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:44.060
Literally what most people do they wake up and before even leaving their bed, but they're checking their phone

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:50.020
The thing you should do when your alarm goes off particularly if it's an alarm and you need to get up is without even thinking

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.500
About it stand up

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:56.780
I don't care if you stand up like a zombie and then check your phone standing by the side of your bed

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.140
You just need to get out of the bed right get upright

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:07.700
That was advice given to me by some random life coach on YouTube. Usually I hate life coaches on YouTube

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.320
They're like I wake up every day at 3 a.m. And do like

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:19.220
Deadlifts of horses until 5 a.m. And then I eat 17 breakfasts before I deadlift some more horses and then at 9

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:24.100
I'm ready to start my day job. I'm just like that that isn't life coaching. That's just insanity. Thank you

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:30.940
Okay, so we do have a question here apologies I'm talking about deadlifting courses and missing the fact that there's still a question

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.880
Lex says what defines the order of items in the inventory there?

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:42.800
That broke recently actually and kind of scared me. I jumbled the order of a folder and I thought I'd lost something

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:49.380
But I'm not quite sure I think it's like the date I'd have to look I haven't opened the codebase today

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.420
I can open it. I don't know how much longer I'll be here. I'll go ahead and open it

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.940
There's a defined order. I can just like control T around and find it

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.220
All right. Codebase is loading. IntelliSense is just like

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:07.820
My RAM is just skyrocketing. I see other questions feel free to do feel free to keep them coming

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.120
I will be answering this question from Lex by just control T around for a little bit

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.980
So if you got any other questions, please drop them in there

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.460
Yeah, I don't actually have the source of architects. I don't think so. At least I remember what was in there

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.420
Am I one of the empty ones?

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.460
engine

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.460
control T

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.860
inventory

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.260
browser

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.500
Active avatar color is color dot magenta

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.780
Yay, and that's sort of like mixed down a little bit

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.660
Do you try initialize? Here it is. Start task root

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.940
open

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:48.660
Open begin generating update directory items. There we go. That'll do it

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.140
Yeah, this will probably take a little bit longer than I have time to like dig into it

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.740
Let me see if the private variable has more on it

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.020
Okay, it looks like whatever order the API returns it in

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.900
That's a sort of question I guess I can answer like so

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.620
it used to be the every single part of

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.140
Neos that

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:23.940
Fruix created was sort of automatically ended up in the same Visual Studio solution and

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.540
then part of that Visual Studio

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.940
Part of that Visual Studio solutions post build script will

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:38.340
Copy it to the the unity side of things such that they were all synced up

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.460
So what I predict happened was at one point

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.380
architects and Gen X and stuff like that were part of the

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:52.660
the Neos solution and were copied to the unity directory and the unity directory is

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.700
Just sort of built on top of like every time we need to rebuild unity project we rebuild unity project

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:04.380
And then that will update the DLLs that do update but the ones that don't update just kind of live there

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.860
It is something that I want to clean up

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.060
As well as any dead code that we have we have a bunch of stuff

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.140
That's just like completely commented out on the code base. I'm getting rid of

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.180
Strange stuff where I'm just like, oh, that's cool

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.540
Then like weird components that don't make any sense

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.180
Shout out to

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.180
Where is it up down?

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.740
I need to switch branches to find this

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.420
If Syro is here or a panda's here

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.420
He's like up down control, I can't remember the name of it it's in uncategorized

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.780
It is a very very weird component

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.700
That is just designed to make something go up and down

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.900
And it's beautiful and we have a lot of fun with it like that though. That's sort of like weird stuff. I'm trying to clean up

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.980
I think it's part of Classroom. That's probably why I don't see it anymore. We split classroom off to its own repository

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.540
Yeah

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.700
Architects was probably I don't know I would have to ask freaks

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.820
But like if I could guess based on just their naming scheme, it would probably be sort of like architectural tools

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:14.540
A good example of that might actually be stuff that is in my public folder under tools architecture tools

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:19.200
So I have a staircase generator in there. I have an archway generator

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.380
I had sort of grand visions for additional generators, but then the

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:31.420
Japanese community made the builder tip and that's much superior so I stopped working on that builder tip much more superior

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:37.020
like mathematically it should be possible if you're using primitives to

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.620
say

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.620
Give me a four by four room

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.100
With a door here and here and here and here

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:49.500
And then it should be able to like mathematically figure out using a metric type of logic, but you should be able to figure out

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.620
Wait logic. This is so dlc that is

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:58.940
Yeah, we'll clean that stuff up as soon as we can um, let's take a look

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.740
Make sure i'm not missing any questions, and then we'll leave off. Okay, so that's done. That's done. That's done. That's done. That's done

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:10.220
Scroll down to oh marcus. Is it spelt colour or color depends where you are. Um, there's this interesting channel

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.940
Which I can't find right now because it will probably take too long

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:18.380
I will find it and then i'll drop it in the office hours text chair. Um, which goes over sort of the

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:24.780
Origins of words and um, an interesting one. I watched it's actually a youtube short channel

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.660
So, you know, you watch like 20 and you're just like where is my life gone?

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:33.020
Uh was about the difference between the pronunciation of herb and and how you americans say it which is herb

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.380
um

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.380
In some parts of america, of course

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:42.140
Well, you just don't pronounce the h for some reason and you really over stress the b and all sorts of weird stuff like that

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.460
But that was all explained and I found that kind of interesting

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.760
Um, a lot of the sort of differences in spelling and also pronunciation

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:54.060
Come from the distances that existed between america and the uk when it was like, you know

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:58.140
First in existence and developing and and you know using language. It's like cool

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:03.100
Remember it used to be like I don't know like a two-week boat ride to get between there and we didn't have the internet

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.100
So that's cool

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.460
I always think about that like, you know, I fly back and forth from america quite often

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.100
And it's like I don't know what to do with my life. I don't know what to do with my life

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.700
And it's like, you know, that doesn't you know, seven hours eight hours

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.980
Isn't that long compared to a two-week boat ride is what it used to be?

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.020
And this is a two-week boat ride without any electronics remember like I don't know what they did

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.820
like

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.820
What would you do for two weeks on a boat?

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.660
It's not like a particularly nice boat as well because it's like it's just like a transport boat. It's not a cruise

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.520
Same thing goes with uh, the titanic, um, when you watch the titanic

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.720
Pay more attention to the the lower class decks

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.640
Because those are basically sort of university dorms or in some cases

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.600
They look like prison cells where people were just there for however long the titanic was meant to you know

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.160
Um journey, which is a long time

00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:02.160
Anyway, if we're talking about the titanic, I believe that we have gone off track enough to cancel, uh, cancel end office hours. However, um

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:09.200
Um, speaking as I mentioned the titanic if anyone would like to um play a video game, which is amazing

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.680
You should play titanic adventure out of time

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.520
um

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.040
it is just like

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.360
One of the like best pieces of of 90s video gaming I have ever seen

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.920
Please play it don't question it if you don't know anything about it and you're you know, you've never played it

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.080
don't question anything just

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.560
Just please just go play it

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:36.080
Uh, marco says that there's a question actually. Thank you. Lex for pointing out. What happens if you delete empty dlls, uh

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:42.000
Uh, if they're not referenced anywhere, it should be fine. But ideally don't do that. Don't give me as a reason to hate you

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.400
and with that we'll leave off play titanic adventure out of time and uh

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.400
I will uh, see you guys next week ping me, uh questions help

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.160
If you've got other questions and uh notes and stuff will be up when we get to them. All right

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.880
I will see you guys later. I gotta push like five buttons because they change the way that you end stages

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.880
So here we go. Bye. Bye
