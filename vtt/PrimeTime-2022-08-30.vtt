WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
Alright everyone, it is now 5pm, so we're going to go ahead and get started.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.840
Once again, sorry for the delay, I just lost track of time, realised it was 20 past, and

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.840
I'm like that's a bit unfair to start it this late, so we rolled it forwards to the next

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.840
hour.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.040
Additionally, an announcement here which I'll also put after this one is that there will

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.560
be no office hours coming up in a random date that I don't know until I look at my calendar

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.960
because I'm out of the country for a little bit.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.940
That is the wrong calendar, so let me just swap to the right calendar, I have too many

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.940
Google accounts.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.400
Ok, it should be on this calendar, but it is not.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:41.320
There will be no office hours on the 6th and the 13th of September, I'll put that in the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.840
doobly-doos once we're done there, because 6th and the 13th, I'm out of the country.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.960
I realised I'd accidentally scheduled that to miss 2, but the flight on my way out is

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.900
at 19.30 or 7.30 if you guys use non-24 hour clocks, and I could totally do the office

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.840
hours at 4pm on that date, but hey, let's get to the airport earlier.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.760
No office hours on those two dates, the 6th and the 13th.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.760
So the next office hours after this one will be on the 20th, which sounds scary because

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.080
it's basically like the end of September will be the next one, anyway.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.640
Let's move on with the questions, and we'll get started with SLS's question, which is

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.640
actually I guess two questions.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.240
First of all, do I check the office hours Google form?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.360
I do, I do check it every week, sometimes I forget, but I'm getting to have it checking

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.360
every week.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.080
I actually have a notepad document which is like shit to do at office hours that you keep

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.100
forgetting to do, and so yes, we're going to go ahead and check it.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.260
As those questions were entered before office hours, we'll go for those first.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.880
So the question we have here that is not answered is why was the force reticle above horizon

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.920
launch argument implemented by DMX asked that?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.040
I don't know.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.920
There are a lot of weird command line arguments that were created and added when we were using

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.600
much more varied hardware, so this is before some standardization of the hardware.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.440
Now VR hardware isn't standardized at all, but before the realms of sort of like Vive,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.380
SteamVR, OpenXR, the Index, et cetera, and Oculus, there were a bunch of additional headsets

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.280
that were there, they did different things, and there were a bunch of sort of features

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.320
that we didn't have in Neos, and that led to a bunch of stuff being added.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.160
For example, there's like command line arguments which will turn another user into like a camera,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.580
that was before we had the camera streaming UI, like you could turn a user into a camera

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.600
and it would just follow you around, it was a little weird.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.600
That still does exist, I forget what the property is, but you can see that if you open up the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.200
old Neos launcher and look around there, there's a bunch of stuff there that exists.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.760
I have no idea why it's there, I've just remembered that there was a GitHub issue mentioned about

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.640
it, but I just can't remember what that's about, it's something to do with 360s, I don't

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.640
know.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.400
Take a look, figure it out, if you let me know, if you find out, let me know.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.280
Moving forwards to the next question we have now, which is actually in the Office Hours

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.960
text chat, from Stifle, Stifle says, besides item texture thumbnail source, are there any

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.360
other hidden gems in the uncategorized section of components that are not being used that

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.360
it should?

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.120
So for those unaware, item texture thumbnail source will update and change the thumbnail

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.920
of an item that you saved to your inventory to be a specific thumbnail.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.120
This is great because if you don't do this, it will just take a photo when you hold it,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.360
which can go wrong with things like tools and stuff that have lasers or big items, sometimes

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.640
their thumbnail just looks terrible.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.120
So I've seen a lot of people that are making use of those to sort of make sort of placards

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.440
or banners for their items to make it look easier to find them, so do check out item

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.420
texture thumbnail source, I believe there's a tutorial on my channel about that.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.540
As for other components in uncategorized, there are far too many in there for me to

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.040
remember specifically, so I won't really be able to answer that one efficiently, there

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.280
are lots in there that shouldn't be used, there are lots in there that should be used.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.000
I think destroy proxy is still in there, no actually destroy proxy got moved, destroy

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.320
proxy is a cool one, destroy proxy allows you to basically say like, hey, when this

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.840
item is destroyed, also destroy this other item.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.240
I would like people to use that more on things like weapons, if you have ammo or guns or

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.280
grenades or any sort of ammo that's really existing rather than being a particle effect,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.200
maybe consider destroy proxy such that when the gun gets destroyed, all the mess it made

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.800
in the world gets destroyed.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.200
There's that very popular tranquilizer gun that doesn't do that, I hate the tranquilizer

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.680
gun because I don't know, all the new users seem to find it and then they shoot me with

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.800
it and I get really annoyed, but when that tranquilizer gun is deleted, the ammo stays

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.160
behind and just like in the floor, it's just like a big tranq dart in the floor and that's

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.320
annoying so destroy proxy can save you there.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.440
Destroy proxy is also good for template-based creation, if you're like, yo, if I'm duplicating

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.200
this thing, then I want to link it back to the original thing, a bit like the ammo scenario

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.240
but also comes up in UI sometimes when I'm making UI, if that's it for that question.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.120
No user found says, have you been working on anything interesting lately, stuff you're

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.140
excited to release or speak about?

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.600
Nothing that I'm excited to release or speak about unfortunately right now.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.400
Moving forwards, Storm says, what are you working on that made you late today?

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.020
I would love to say that I had an amazing excuse, but I was just playing a video game

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.740
and had an eye on the clock and then got distracted by the video game being slightly more difficult.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.040
So I blinked and I'm like, oh, it's way past, whoops, my bad.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.720
I'm going to reenter an alarm into my calendar for various things that I need to be aware

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.720
of.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.840
I did used to have a calendar like schedule for the office hours, but it ran out.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.480
I have too many Google accounts.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.680
Moving forwards, Stifle says, can one write to Wiki pages about the world's publisher

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.680
to the creator jam?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.920
Yeah, you can write whatever you want on the newest Wiki.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.240
Keep it tidy.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.440
I'll tidy out for you if it's really messy and you're struggling with the formatting,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.440
et cetera.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.360
But whatever you'd like to put on there, it's a community project.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.820
You can put all sorts of stuff in there.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.840
It would be great to see any of that sort of stuff.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.380
As a reminder, anyone on the planet can edit the newest Wiki.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.380
We have some troubles of logging into the newest Wiki, please do check the Wiki channel

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.120
for information about how to log into there.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.200
And if you're interested in contributing to the Wiki, on the left hand side of the Wiki's

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.320
menu, there is the contributing to the Wiki menu.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.120
Again, just to reiterate this, you don't need permission from me.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.480
You don't need special privilege.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.020
You don't need like a ticket.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.020
You don't need a golden ticket.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.920
You don't need to go to Willy Wonka's factory.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.720
You can just go ahead and edit the Wiki.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.960
Additionally, if you're making Wiki pages, please don't send me Google docs that have

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.960
Wiki pages in them.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.380
Just write it straight in the Wiki.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.640
If you don't want to put it in place, like in the actual place on the Wiki that you want,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640
make a temporary page.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.640
Put the temporary page onto your user page, and then we can look at it there.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.400
I've noticed this happens a lot with writing documentation across many roles and jobs I've

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.400
had.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.540
Lots of people write their documentation in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, and then when

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.440
it comes time to make that into actual documentation, it just won't work.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.720
Because they're in their own word, they're thinking about word, they're thinking about

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720
a document.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.360
Whereas when they're in Wiki or Markdown or whatever the hell the documents are written

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.640
in, they're thinking about the way that the documentation is written in that language

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.160
and it allows them to sort of think more precisely about it.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.320
A good example here being links in Wikis are a little bit weird until you get used to them,

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.900
but once you're used to them, you just put them everywhere.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.160
But there has to be intention there.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160
Same with headings.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.980
I've lost count of the amount of people that will use Word or Google Docs headings incorrectly

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.160
and drive me absolutely mad.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.960
So write it on the Wiki if you're planning for it to be on the Wiki, and don't send me

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960
Google Docs.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.220
Send me temporary pages of Wiki or whatever you like.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.360
Moving forwards, check says, is there anything you can tell us that you're working on for

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.360
the future?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360
Yeah, lots.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.120
You can take a look at the roadmap on the GitHub public roadmap.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.700
Everything there is still planned to be worked on.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.000
Of course, C announcements for the stuff that's going on there that I don't want to dwell

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.680
on too much.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.280
Nothing in particular for this week to be mentioned.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.520
Basement says, is there a component that does a save proxy like the destroy proxy component?

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.520
I don't know.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.560
I also don't know if the code base is open right now.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.560
There might be.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.840
I think I've seen something like that.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.840
So do take a look.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840
I'll take a look as well.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.840
Let's open the code base.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.840
Might as well just open it now.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.400
It can just sort of struggle with us whilst I'm sat here answering other questions.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.480
Moving forwards, Jack says, can an RTX 3060 TI run Neos?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.640
Yes.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.720
If it has 3 and X in it from Nvidia, you're probably better off than I am.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.080
I run on a 2080 TI.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.960
So excellent.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.960
On the other side of that, if you're on a 1080, you'll still be able to run it.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.640
But a 1080 is getting old these days now that the 3 series is coming out.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.040
I heard news about the 4 series soon.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040
So cool.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.040
B&amp;B two generations behind.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.840
But hey, I'm not going to drop too grand on a graphics hard anytime soon.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.780
Getu says, is there a tool for making animations in Neos with game objects that don't involve

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.720
coding the whole Tween node of all inputs and outputs or is there a new way of making

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720
animations in Neos?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.720
Okay.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.200
So you have multiple options there.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.160
So option number one is what you say with the Tween node.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.920
You can also do mathematical animations, which are often all you need for really basic stuff.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.320
For example, getting planets orbiting another planet.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.080
Someone's like, can I make an animation file?

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.800
Just use sine and cos and it'll be done.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.320
Takes a few seconds.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.880
As for more complex animations, the two options that you have are firstly, animJ.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.580
Lex and I are working on understanding animJ a lot better.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.240
We got almost to the end, but then I really don't understand how the curve preset works,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240
but whatever.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.240
So animJ is an option.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.240
There is an animJ Wiki page.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.560
It is kind of bare bones.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.840
Do take a look at it.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.760
That is more sort of writing the animations there.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.200
I believe there are a couple of people working on sort of animJ exporters for various tools

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.600
that'll let you get some sort of complicated animations.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.120
Additionally, you can make Blender or FBX based animations and import them and run them.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.440
That is what a lot of people do.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.560
You can swap between animations provided they have the same bone rigs and number of keyframes

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.480
or keyframe control points or whatever.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.280
And that works out quite nicely.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.320
For example, I have an object I think in my public folder under tutorials, which has just

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.960
a sort of blocky blob man that does three animations of a button on the front to show

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.560
that you can swap between them.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.040
There's also worlds that make use of that.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.520
A particular note just off the top of my head is eco, one of the MC entries where there

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.520
is an AI system of little foxes that walk around mining ore and trees.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.280
Those will go from walking to digging, back to walking animations very, very easily.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.480
I seem to remember I edited eco in one of the creator jams, there was a creator jam

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:29.480
which used eco as a base and I made a cow milking little fox that went up and milked

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.480
cows.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.480
I didn't have time to bring in another animation, so the milking cow animation was actually

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.440
chopping a tree down, so it walked up to the cow and just was whacking it with an axe and

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.440
milk came out.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.040
A river says, how hard is it to learn logic from someone coming from C sharp?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.000
Strangely, you'll have a little bit of a better time because you know C sharp and because

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.840
you know generic programming, but the key thing I want to tell you is stop with comparisons.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.440
It's one of the things that annoys me the most when people learn logics is they say

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.000
like, what language is it like?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.240
It's not really like any language.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.880
Is there any other language you know of that you can build in VR and it was made by yellow

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.720
dog man over in the Czech Republic?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.600
No, there's no other language like that, right?

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.800
So you got to think that through and try not to make comparisons.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.320
Of course comparisons are easy when you're trying to learn stuff, but sometimes they

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320
get in the way.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.320
There are people that just like cannot learn logics because they can't overcome that sort

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.560
of comparison style view.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.580
You know, they'll start writing logics and they'll be like, well, if I was going to do

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.240
this in C sharp, I'll do it this way.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.440
And it's like, well, that does help, but at a certain point you kind of have to just leave

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.360
it by the roadside and carry on into logics land.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.760
So do keep that in mind when you're learning stuff.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.240
Talking about that, there is this, I want to do a video on this at some point.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.280
Let me see if I can get it.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:51.320
Is this, like, abbreviation, there it is.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.920
It's actually on my bookmark toolbar.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.920
Here it is.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.520
It says learn anything faster.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.160
It's by this sort of life coach that does have paid products, but you can go by.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.040
I'm not endorsing his products.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.640
I'm just saying read the free article.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.620
But the first part of his faster abbreviation, like an acronym, I guess, is forget.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.760
And it's like the knowledge that we already have keeps us limited.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.480
So in order to learn faster, we need to forget what we think we already know.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.600
And that was like, yep, that makes perfect sense for logics.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.600
Forget what you already know.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.120
In some cases, it's situational that you need to forget it.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.320
You'll have a lot of better time writing C sharp because you know basic logic, basic

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.020
programming terms, basic booting operators, stuff like that.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:39.480
You know what the term variable means, but don't think about classes or files or functions

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.520
or collections because those don't exist in logics.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.560
Bad Halo Ninja points out external slot saver.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.320
I think external slot saver is the one I was referring to.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.020
It's under utility.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.280
It sounds like it does what it is.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.760
I remember when it was added, I just haven't used it or had a need to yet.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.300
Jack says can Neos be used for schools in the future like coding school, 3D art school?

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.360
It already is being used in schools in a lot of cases.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.040
There's a lot of stuff that has been used in education.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:12.600
I'm actually in a newspaper and on a sort of short 30 second piece of news is some educational

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.600
work I did in Neos.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.000
So yes, it's being used in schools.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.680
Moving forwards, electronic says the wiki states should look into some of the permissions

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680
of cloud variables.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.680
Any information to share on those?

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.800
Yes, I paused that work whilst we're in the sort of development hiatus because even if

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.360
I figured it out, I wouldn't be able to change anything.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.720
The permissions around the contacts one are just a little confusing.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.000
I had a bunch of debug lines in the code base that I was running on a build and then I lost

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.680
them for some reason.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.340
So I need to figure them out.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.160
The description there from the wiki that's crossed out might be correct.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.900
It's just I was having a conversation with someone and we thought that they were not

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.600
correct and so I updated it to say like, hey, we're looking into them.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.040
I know that's been a long time, but it is what it is right now.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.760
Lots of stuff going on that just isn't fun.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.480
Storm says it was beating the cow in the bucket.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.480
That's correct.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.920
I managed to swap out the axe for a bucket, but it was still the axe chopping animation.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.520
So the little fox guy would be like whacking this cow with a bucket in the style of using

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.160
an axe and then it would walk away with milk in the bucket.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.520
Jack says in the educational system.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.000
I don't know what you mean by that.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.720
If you mean like the educational system of a country, yes.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.440
We did some education in Queensland, in Australia.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.460
There's lots of stuff going on in Europe, especially near the classroom, but it's used

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.460
a lot.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.440
We've even got some community members.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:40.780
Tom Fox, I believe, is doing tutoring in mathematics for some of his students that he tutors using

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.780
Neos.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:48.380
That's why he was looking for a whiteboard style set up where you could actually erase

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.960
it a little bit easier.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.920
Right now with our pens, you can erase whole brush strokes, but you can't erase like say

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.860
if you draw a line, you wouldn't be able to put a whiteboard eraser in the middle and

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:58.860
split that line in two.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.400
You'd have to destroy the entire line.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.040
That's what they were looking for.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.320
Jack says would Neos be on PlayStation VR 2 or the new meta headset?

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.600
We don't know and can't make commitments to headsets that don't have any details or are

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.480
not released or are not on our hands.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.040
The way it works with devices is if we get the device into the hands of a team member,

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.960
usually fruits, although there's a couple of devices that I will personally be trying

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.920
to implement simply because they will arrive at my apartment and if I don't implement them,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.800
then they'll sit on a shelf gaining dust.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.200
But if there is a developer kit, developer program or something like that, please forward

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.060
it to us or open a GitHub issue about it.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.300
Please don't email the companies about us.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.300
That's kind of rude.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.280
Just imagine like, okay, let's just say for example, a new company and we'll call it cheese

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.480
comes out and they come out with the cheese VR one.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.960
It's the best headset ever.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:54.300
You want Neos to use it and 50,000 people email cheese like please help Neos integrate.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:59.240
And meanwhile, business executives or people from cheese are already speaking to us.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.480
It's just like noise, right?

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.960
So open up an issue and tell us to go speak to them, then we'll go speak to them and figure

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960
it out.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.600
If you have information to share, like where their developer kit is or whatever, put it

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.860
in a GitHub issue and then we'll be able to go from there rather than like spamming them

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.860
with like messages.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.720
We had that with one headset, I can't remember which in particular.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.560
No user found says, hey, do you remember that system you revealed you're working on the

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.120
previous product time, the bones system, I think any progress on the updates of that?

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.440
Yeah, that's going well.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.760
Actually we're planning on sort of swapping out some of the meshes there, because we can't

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.240
give people access to the meshes, like pictures and stuff like that are okay, but access to

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.520
the meshes is bad because they're actual like patient files.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.480
But if we swap them out to sort of like basically a skull and a leg bone that we've downloaded

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.560
from sketch fab, we can totally do that.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.440
And I plan to do that so I can do a video overview of how that world works.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:52.200
Because that would be super exciting to see how that works and talk about it later on,

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.400
depending on how the project goes, we might publish that world as a sort of example.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.320
Right now it's still under heavy development, but that's actually not Neos team related.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.040
That's like what I do in my actual existence.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.600
No user found says Neos can run on Android smartphone.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.600
It technically can, yes, speak to Zlinka for that, they are managing to do that.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.220
It can also run on a Steam deck.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.240
Interesting that we don't really expect these platforms to be supported, but they are.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.240
Enjoy.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.880
If your phone blows up, don't blame me.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.560
Yeah, I don't know anything about the Steam deck.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.000
The Steam deck came out at a time where I couldn't spend as much money as I usually

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.920
was spending, so I just had to sort of pass on that.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.320
I'll buy one when I have money.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.640
Lux, this is a very long question.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.240
Let me get started in reading this.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.560
I've been messing with asset deduplication, trying to understand it better and was wondering

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.280
how the material set component works with respect to this.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.080
Specifically whenever I add the material set component and place materials that are not

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.680
stored in the object itself, duplicating this object seemingly does not use the same assets.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.800
Is there a way to get it to use the same asset system properly or am I going about the wrong

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800
way?

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.760
I don't know how that does that.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.120
I'd have to look into that one, unfortunately.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.600
The material set component might not be registering materials in the same way that a mesh renderer

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.600
does.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.940
There's two ways to refer to a material, right?

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.680
If you do create empty objects, add a material to it, Neos knows that that material isn't

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.440
being used anywhere, but if that material is then used somewhere, such as in a render

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.680
or whatever, it knows it's being used and then the asset system sort of kicks in and

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.120
tries to sort of preserve that asset to not be deleted so that the mesh that's using it

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.760
doesn't go to checkerboard.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.720
That's also why there's things like asset loader and stuff like that, that'll keep the

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.840
asset loaded.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.800
I don't know if material set's doing that properly.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.800
I'll have to take a look.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.320
I've got like two things to take a look at now, I don't know.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.880
What was I opening the code for before?

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.760
I was opening it for Basement Nerd, we found that with external slot saver, and now I'm

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.200
looking at the code for material set.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.000
Looking forwards, Jack says the PSVR 2 already has a dead kit.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.200
It got leaked.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.640
See the keyword there being leaked?

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.120
That means not allowed to use.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.040
That's what the word leak means.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.960
Sure, we're aware of it, sure we're aware that Facebook, Meta are going to announce

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.400
a headset soon, I've heard it's in October, but until there is like a button that says

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.160
you are an application, click here to officially be allowed to use this dev kit, we can't use

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.160
it.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.400
It depends on the individual sort of dev kit, dev relations style thing.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.280
There have been a couple of headsets that we've had to sign paperwork for in the past,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.880
so like, you know, it being leaked is another thing from it, like being available.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.160
Moving down to more questions, Aaron says, I think this was asked before but I don't

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.080
remember the answer so I apologize, do you have plans for now for any marketing for the

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.800
game once you start, guys?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.800
Start doing updates again.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.760
We don't have any plans right now, of course, because of the, you know, we're not doing

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.960
updates right now, but I'm sure we will once we get started again.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.640
Again, it will probably be sort of more targeted and dependent on the sort of like updates

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.880
that we do.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.560
We are grateful for the rushes that we've had, you know, the news is coming in due to

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.560
the VR chat stuff, due to the metaverse boom, due to thrill seekers video, we're grateful

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.380
to all of those people, if any of you are in the office today, thank you for coming

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.120
and trying us.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.640
But controlled growth is a little better than uncontrolled growth, so we want to be very

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.240
careful about when we do that, how we do it, and what we do.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:24.360
I know people want us to be like, yo, Twitter, here's $5,000, put us on all of the timelines,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:30.200
shove us here, I want us to, you know, here, TikTok, take $5,000, shove our TikToks down

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.200
people's throats.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.280
It's just like life doesn't work like that, life doesn't work like that.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.840
Jack the Duck is still talking about the leaked and deleted and pictures and scary details.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:47.280
If there is not a website by the company that says you can use this, we cannot use it.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.900
I guess you can kind of view it like a museum, right?

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.360
We are aware that the Mona Lisa exists.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.320
I can go visit the Mona Lisa, I forget where it is, I think it's still in the Louvre, I

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.320
don't remember.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.400
Anyway, bad paintings, I don't know where it is, but anyway.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.000
I know that the Mona Lisa exists, I can look at it, I can look at photos of it, I can look

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.320
at information about it, but I can't touch it.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.320
I can't lick it.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.200
Like it's not gonna happen.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200
Same with that dev kit, right?

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.160
I know that these headsets exist, I know that they're cool, I know that they're gonna be

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.240
announced, I've seen leaked photos, I can't do anything with that information, I can't

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.240
touch it.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.640
And yeah, that's probably gonna go in the quote channel, I can't lick the Mona Lisa.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.520
No, I said it was a bad example because I don't know where it is, like if I'm talking

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.680
about a painting, I would rather I knew where it was.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.680
I did see a post recently actually, there's one of the image writing AIs and I don't want

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.320
to talk about these for like forever because it's just a long conversation, but one of

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:44.200
the image AIs can sort of take a given image and expand it to be a larger image.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.440
And so what it does is like it will draw around the edges of the painting what it thinks should

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.920
be there if it was like a zoomed out picture.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.160
And someone fed it the Mona Lisa and it drew like her as a sort of like, I don't know,

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.120
TikTok influencer because like that's what it was trained on or whatever.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.120
So it was like Mona Lisa in the middle and then as it like expanded outwards, it was

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:10.320
quite clearly like a sort of, you know, 2020 style lady sat there with like whatever was

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.080
added and it was kind of interesting to see.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.320
Let me see if I can go ahead and get that for you.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:21.240
Looks like there's some additional posts that do have good copies of it.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.800
They've sort of expanded it very well, but I did see one that expanded it to be like

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.720
completely confusing.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.560
This one here took into mind the like actual style, but another one when it expanded it

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.440
was like in a room at a table, it didn't make any sense.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.520
Whereas that one is, you could see that of maybe being where she was painted.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.680
Let's scroll down and take a look.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.560
Jack says, can you leak anything we aren't supposed to use yet?

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.120
Yes.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.040
In the current build of Neos that you're on, there is a variable type called colorX.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.040
Don't use it.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.800
That's part of color management, isn't ready for you guys to use yet, will be once we get

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.500
color management, but you can see it and you can have a look at it.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.740
You can also look at how god-awful it is in the inspector to look at, but there you go.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.480
It's just there because like color management is such a big change that like part of it

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.040
got merged in a previous build.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.040
So you can see it.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.040
But yeah.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.080
No User Found has an interesting question.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.640
So No User Found says, what are your thoughts about how a multi-million billion dollar company

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.900
like Meta can't make a good VR social metaverse, but two people and a bunch of developers can

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.600
make a good VR metaverse?

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.040
It's a problem of focus.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.320
So a bit like that picture of the Mona Lisa zooming out that we just did here, right?

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.360
Could DaVinci have painted that entire landscape?

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.360
Yes.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.120
But he didn't want to because he was doing a picture of Mona Lisa.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.040
I don't know if it's the name of the painting or the name of the subject of the painting.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040
So whatever.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.780
I'll just call her Mona from now on, maybe Lisa.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.760
He was like, I want to do a painting of Lisa.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.200
So he painted Lisa.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.320
He didn't paint the trees around her.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.040
And the same thing that goes for the metaverse.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.280
I've worked at large companies and I know that focus sometimes becomes a problem, but

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.440
it becomes a problem because you're paying too many people.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.720
Let's say you have a thousand people.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.320
One of them has to focus on something that doesn't make sense to be focused on.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.440
Like, okay, let's do another basic example.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.440
Okay.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.360
You're building a house and someone's focusing on electric, someone's focusing on plumbing,

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.160
someone's focusing on the roof, someone's working on structure and integrity.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.800
Someone's focusing on what color the cushions on the couch are going to be.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.800
Guarantee it, right?

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.360
And they need to, because it's like a big company and they need to focus on that.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.120
But then like times that buy a hundred, right?

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.480
And then you've got all these meetings, all this information, all these people, all these

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.440
budgeting, all these teams.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.160
And it's just like, cool.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.600
We've just spent six months talking about the color of a cushion, but the electrics

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.600
don't work.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.380
When I turn on the living room light, the garbage disposal turns on like that.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.680
That's what happens.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:54.080
And like driving that and making that work at a large company is like a huge like leadership

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.080
thing.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.080
And the leadership are in place.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.000
Now that isn't to say that Metta's leadership is bad.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.520
I don't actually know anything about it.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.840
Like I'm laughing at the memes, you know, the, the, the Zuck picture in front of the

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.280
Eiffel Tower, but that's like, that's just me laughing at the picture.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.360
I haven't done enough research or investigation into what might be going on there from a leadership

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.600
point of view to cause that lack of focus.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.320
But focus is the problem there.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.640
When we have the smaller team that we do have, it means that we have focus through another

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.000
realm, which is we don't have a thousand people building a house.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.400
We don't have someone thinking about the couch.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.880
In this case, the couch might be that our UI looks absolutely garbage.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.480
Like it does, right?

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.400
We're going to work on it when we can.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.880
But when we do that, we're going to focus on that for a bit.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.240
And it means that maybe the electrics aren't being focused on like the electrics are still

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.100
going to work, but maybe you don't have the air conditioning unit is maybe not running

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.640
as effectively as it should.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.160
So we have focus simply by a sort of function of existing.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.280
I hope the answer worked.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.800
Like there's so much nuance to that, that I could probably talk for hours.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.800
So I'll leave it there.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.800
Jumping around.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.200
Dorky does say build the house before the couch is what we're going to be doing for

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.200
UI updates.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.140
Your update like gets like conflated a lot.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.360
Like a lot of people think it's just one item, like it's a big ball of string and the UI

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.240
update will just launch one day and everything will change.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240
No.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.280
We will work on two things in parallel, which is the UI systems, which are like a slider,

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:21.420
a checkbox, a text input field, a square that those things can go inside.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.420
And then the other thing will be a part of the UI and we'll work on them together.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.840
So it will be like, Oh, we're working on the settings UI now for the settings UI, we need

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.320
to update how sliders work, not sliders.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.840
The component that allows you to move stuff in the world.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.280
Sliders is in the volume slider, right?

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.600
Well, we need to update the volume slide.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.600
Okay.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600
So we'll update the volume slider.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.600
Cool.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.820
Now the settings UI can use that new volume slider.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.060
And it means the next time that we need a slider, we don't need to work on the volume

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.060
slider.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.060
Right.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.060
And then we just keep working on that.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.060
We're like, okay, we're done with settings.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.060
Let's move on to inventory.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.880
Oh, we need some form of grid that can show thumbnails, we'll work on that as a part of

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.880
the system.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.880
Now we can work on the inventory.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.160
So a little bit of like washing one window, washing another window, eventually you'll

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.960
get like the whole picture.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.400
It's not like we're just going to drop in one day with like a nuclear bomb and go like,

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.280
boom, the UI's done.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.120
Moving forwards, rather than me wittering on about various sort of analogies that get

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:17.940
more and more obtuse, electronic says, how far along was, is color management?

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.720
Last time I recall hearing it was in close testing and getting ready to push to danger

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720
testers.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720
It is close.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.840
Of course, we're not doing updates right now.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.820
So it's less close than it was.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.140
Probably a better question for Geens, who isn't here.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.760
But I know that every time we talk about it, I end up sort of misunderstanding color even

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760
more.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.620
You have to remember that I am slightly colorblind, and so I've just kind of ignored color management.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.780
Not from a perspective of I don't care, but from a perspective of like, I can't help as

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.020
best as I could.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.920
I'll still help with testing, make sure the stuff makes sense, but we'll need other testers

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.000
at that time to be like, yeah, this looks right.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.640
I can't tell if it's too many yellows and greens, it seems.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.960
I'm just like, god, if your world is yellow or green, I'm probably confused.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.720
Electronic says, could we get that as a clip?

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.560
Yeah, the recording of this Office Hours will be up on Sounder.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.320
You can go ahead and download it and cut it up and be like, boom, boom, bash.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.320
Yeah, that's another thing.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.240
Storm says that games was trying to find a way to add it without breaking everything.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.200
That's another point.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.660
To give another, again, incredibly obtuse and crude analogy, color management is going

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:28.040
to be a little bit like bashing you over the head, removing your eyes, and putting in different

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.960
eyes, and then waking you up.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.360
We want that to be as smooth as possible.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.440
What I mean by that is like, stuff is going to look different.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.520
It's going to look different.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.160
And there's no way to make that not be different.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.920
That's just color management in general.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.640
It's going to make stuff look different.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.760
It's about making that smooth.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.920
It's like saying like, hey, let's install the color management build.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.720
Let's go through the top 100 worlds and make sure they don't look dumb.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.400
If they do look dumb, let's make sure that we figure out why they look dumb and see if

00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:00.320
that's a problem or it's just a symptom of the color management switch.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.080
So I seem to remember there were some screenshots available.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.440
It might be in the devlog channel of some of the popular worlds back then when it was

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.160
being posted before and after.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.760
Unfortunately, the camera wasn't aligned to the same location because I wanted to do is

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.440
put it on one of those swipey tools.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.400
You know where you can swipe left and right to compare two pictures?

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.840
I wanted to put before and after color management on one of those swipey tools so you could

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.120
be like, woo, woo, woo, and swipe it backwards and forwards and see the difference.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.760
I'm sure we'll get some of those, especially if I'm on the color management build.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.400
I'll get some camera anchors together and make sure I can get some swipey photos.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.800
If you don't know what I mean, I'm sorry, but swipey photos, yeah.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.760
I think it's called onion skinning or something like that.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:42.920
It's similar to like in sort of traditional animation where like old school animation,

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.320
computer animation, not computer animation, sorry, but like by hand animation where they

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:51.800
would like draw a background and then put overlay like plastic paper with the characters

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.680
drawn on them and then flip between them to make sure that they look good between two

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.680
frames.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.600
Like that, swipey photos, yeah.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.840
Moving forwards again because I'm mumbling.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:09.000
Patty says, does Neos work with all FBT?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.120
I know it works with five pucks, but what about Haratora X?

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.000
I don't know what Haratora X is, so I won't be able to comment on that one.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.240
I know that some people have Tundra trackers and that they work.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:25.720
A good example here, which is not for sure a guarantee, but a good example here that

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:33.120
will let you sort of figure it out is does the SteamVR application recognize them as

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.120
pucks?

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.160
If the SteamVR application recognizes them as pucks, then it means that they are compatible

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.240
with SteamVR, which means we should be able to pick them up well.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.440
That isn't, like I said, guaranteed, but it's the closest thing I've got right now.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.240
And Doki actually said that before I even said it, so yeah.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.640
If it doesn't show up as pucks, then you'll have a difficulty there.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.400
I know like Connect won't work out of the box, but you can get like driver for VR or

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.240
something, which then like makes the Connect like pretend to be a Vive puck, so then it

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240
does work.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.240
Or whatever.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.240
I don't know.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240
Mileage may vary.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240
Try it out.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.360
Don't go buying hardware on my say.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.360
That's a big thing as well.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.940
If other people in our community, if the team, if we're talking about it, if we're saying

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.260
we'll implement a piece of hardware, please don't go spending money on our record.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:20.200
I would hate for you to hear a rumor from someone like, Neo is just going to support

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.400
the PSVR 2 day one, and then you'd go spend money and that not be true.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.400
I would hate for that.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.680
So just like make the choice to buy the hardware and don't count on Neo supporting it fully

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.560
until we announce that we do support it fully, is what I'm saying.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.360
Don't spend lots of money without it being confirmed.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.080
Oxy the protogen says, is there any way to get user profiles from the Neo STB stuff?

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.080
There is.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.840
But it looks like Lex has answered you there.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.180
Do remember when it comes to our API, I'm limited in the support that I can provide.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.660
Not because I don't want to provide it, but because we have the stance that it's unsupported.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.520
The reason that we have this is because it might change literally any moment.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:03.280
You might blink, and it might be API.cheese.neos.com forward slash cheese forward slash cheddar

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.880
forward slash user ID might be the way that you get a user ID or a user profile.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.140
We can't guarantee that it's going to stay the same, and so therefore we don't support

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.260
it and we don't document it, because it might change.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.740
If we were to document it, we would establish a sort of handshake between you and our community

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.960
saying, this is how it works.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.020
And then if we broke that, you'd be mad at us.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.680
So we don't do that.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.840
Like it's the lesser of two evils.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.040
Let's go, Ted, and take a look and see if we have more questions.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.480
So electronic says, how about we be mad if you break it anyway?

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.480
You can totally be mad.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.780
We've told you it's unsupported.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.780
So be mad.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.320
We did warn you.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.160
It's like, do not push this button.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.340
It will kill you.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.700
Someone pushes it and they die.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.700
Why did I die?

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.700
Did you read the button?

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.120
I actually have that in a folder somewhere.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.480
I know there's people just pushing buttons in my world.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.560
So I made a button that says, like, if you push this, you'll die.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.160
And lots of people push it.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.640
Jack the Duck says, oh, by the way, it is 1738.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.160
So we're going to cut questions off at 1740.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.160
So to keep that in mind, 1740 questions will be cut off.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.360
Jack says, what do you think about flat screen compatible and VR games like Phosphophobia

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.960
and VRChat?

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.120
Do you think it could attract people from outside of VR to get involved into VR?

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.440
Jungish is quite good, Jack.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.680
Don't worry about it.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.840
I do appreciate the apologies, but you're doing quite well.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.040
It is interesting in that regard, but it also comes with problems.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.880
So you need to think about it.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.280
Again, it's a sort of like focus thing.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.960
I don't know what the VRChat team thinks about this, but I have an inkling.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.880
Is it a problem that there are VRChat users who will never use VR?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.040
Is that a problem?

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.160
And you can have a stance on that, which is yes, or you can have a stance on that, which

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160
is no.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.040
I have an inkling that their stance is no.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:49.080
And then from the inkling of no, it then leads to different choices in the development, such

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.880
as, well, then that means that we need to always be improving our desktop support such

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.800
that it feels like you have all the features of VR without it.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.160
Or if you say yes, then you can be like, well, then we don't care about desktop users.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.120
We should remove all the desktop features.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.280
Good example there being website design.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.400
So when you build a website, you have to make those sorts of decisions about which browsers

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.400
you support.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.440
So as a website developer, you have to basically say, do I want to support Internet Explorer?

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.560
And if you say yes to this question, please go away.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.000
Internet Explorer is dead.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Stop supporting it.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.080
But if you say yes to it, your developers will groan.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.820
Your developers will be grumbly.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:31.120
You will add months and months and months to your development life cycle just simply

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:36.800
because you won't take a stance and say dead browsers are unsupported by our website.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.320
But depending on the business, you'll have to make that decision.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.040
If you're running an enterprise business banking application, you probably will need to support

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.040
Internet Explorer until 2030.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.520
That's just the way it is.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.480
I know that there are some applications that exist, mostly out east, that still require

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.240
Internet Explorer 6 because they use ActiveX stuff.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.240
Is now 17.14.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.240
No more questions.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.520
Diaz says that Babel exists.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.960
I hate Babel.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:09.480
I've seen so many people that will put Babel.js in their tool chain, and then they'll be like,

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.760
and only target the latest Chrome and Firefox.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.760
You know that you can actually just ship next generation JavaScript to Chrome and Firefox

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.600
and they'll just be like, cool, bro.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.760
You don't need Babel if you're doing it correctly.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.420
You need Babel if you're dealing with Internet Explorer, but like I said, you shouldn't.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.120
And then once you're not dealing with Internet Explorer, you can remove half your tool chain

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.680
because you don't need it anymore.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.000
I've seen some incredibly large web pack files that are just like, why?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
You don't need any of that.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.600
If anyone doesn't know what I'm talking about, I'm sorry, that's just web development.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:42.560
Web development in 2022 and in 2021 and in 2020 is just a nightmare of tooling, and it's

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.560
just ridiculous.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.920
I will answer No User Found's question and then we'll leave off, thank you for the reminder,

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.920
Dorky.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.880
I do need to get back to other things.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:55.800
No User Found says do you think when people who haven't experienced VR or the metaverse

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.800
yet see how bad Facebook's metaverse looks and a VR Walmart video, do you think that

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.960
harms the reputation of VR?

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.980
Yes, it does.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:10.080
You can think of it, again, like other things that are similar to that, like video games.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.880
You might be influenced by the big content creators who play those video games on their

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.840
streams, and then you might make a purchasing decision based on that because you aren't

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.840
aware.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:24.920
And so if the VR community isn't putting good content to show this isn't what the metaverse

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.000
is like, then people don't know what it's like.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.560
Speaking of that bone jaw thing that was mentioned above, we're having difficulty with surgeons

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.360
getting them to even understand that when they're wearing a headset, they have depth,

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.020
they have stereoscopic vision.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:43.720
If you aren't aware of what's going on here, in desktop mode, try and align three cubes

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.720
on the same plane.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.560
So try and align them up so that their corners touch in a straight line.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.620
Then do the same thing in VR.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:55.720
If in VR you are moving around, you're rotating them, you're looking from different angles,

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.000
you understand VR.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.680
You understand that there's depth perception, you understand that you're able to influence

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.240
your view in the world, and you understand that if you can't quite see if the cubes are

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.880
lining up, you can move around there.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.920
Now, of course, you can do the same in desktop, but it's not the same because you have to

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.280
do that in desktop, right?

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.240
You might align them in one plane, change your perspective in desktop and be like, oh,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.240
they're completely out of alignment.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:20.080
But in VR, you'll have a much better look if you understand that that depth is there.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.120
We're just seeing people that just don't understand that.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.800
They put on the headset, and for some reason, they don't see the depth is there.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.240
I was actually speaking to Hamish, I said, Jafar, here.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.480
And he said, I'm gonna have to look it up and see if I can actually find the article

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480
about it.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:39.680
And apparently, they took photographs or like paintings of staircases and sort of three-dimensional

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.320
depth-related structures out to uncontacted tribes.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.440
These are tribes that just they have no contact with the rest of the world.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.680
They don't know what the internet is.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.440
They don't really know what like our thoughts of art is.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.500
Of course, they have their own version of art, but they don't know what that is.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.040
And you show them like a picture of some stairs, and they don't see it as stairs.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.500
They don't understand that they would be able to walk up them or the top of the stairs is

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.120
different in depth than the bottom of the stairs.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.780
They'll see basically a stack of cubes rather than stairs because they're not able to process

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.280
that depth information.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.640
If you've grown up on video games, you'll be able to do that as well simply by, I don't

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.480
know, play a first-person shooter, or try and remember back to the first first-person

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.940
shooter that you played.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.560
You wouldn't have understood depth as well as you do there.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.040
That isn't even the hardest problem.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.600
Aaron says, how do doctors not understand that?

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.920
One of the hardest problems we have with doctors and other people that haven't been in VR is,

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.840
oh, no, I won't put on the headset, it'll mess up my hair.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.160
That is the hardest problem we have to solve.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.560
They don't want to mess up their hair.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:39.040
And with that interesting anecdote, I will leave you there and speak to you again on

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.200
the, whatever that date was, on the 20th.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:47.320
If you have any further questions, feel free to direct message me, drop it in the Discord

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.160
or wherever else you might want to speak to people about it.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.160
I will speak to you later.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:39:19.160
Bye-bye.
