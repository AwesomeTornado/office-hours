WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
 So welcome to office hours, it's 4 p.m. We'll get started. If you have any questions, please drop them in the office hours text chat thread

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.080
 I will just @tag office hours again, let them know that we're starting and then we'll see if there's any questions

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.080
 I can't there are can't be that

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.260
 There aren't any currently, but we'll see what happens once I @tag

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.320
 That's @tag

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.960
 Prime time that's fine. We've only got like six people here. Come on guys. Tell your friends. It's it's prime time

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.960
 We're gonna talk about cheese. Um, I

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.920
 I'm just gonna wait for people to join. I think we'll give them a few minutes simply because you know

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.240
 All the people here are like people that are aware of

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.080
 What I was gonna say to start with whilst I was waiting for questions, which is like hey check the announcements channel

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.080
 We have another build. Yeah

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.880
 But cool does anyone

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:58.120
 Does anyone else get really bothered by socks? Not the user like actual socks, right? So my legs just don't don't like socks

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 I don't know if I'm like buying the wrong socks or something. But like

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.000
 Hank was always itchy if I wear socks and sometimes like I'll put them on because I'm leaving the house and I'll forget to take

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.400
 Them off. Yeah, it's like irritation. But it's also like I don't know. It feels like the socks are like clamping my legs too much

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.640
 Anyway, guess we're talking about socks for a bit. There are no questions if you type in the question, we'll stop talking about socks

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.000
 I promise. Oh, we have a natural question. Hell yeah, we can stop talking about socks

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.780
 Although it is a quick question. Yes, the mentor program is open. You can find out more information about it on the wiki

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.960
 I'm preparing the link for you right now. We can find out everything that you'd like to know about that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.180
 So weird like page break that shouldn't be there in in the wiki there. Let me see if I can get rid of that

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.860
 It's logged me out. Great. I'll have to go to the login page

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.760
 So wiki text which is

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.780
 Similar to I guess like other forms of mark mark up etc. It's a little bit like mark down in the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.260
 It is what's called white space sensitive. So in some cases we just see like random line breaks that shouldn't be there

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.440
 There we go. I fixed it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.680
 So yeah, if you're editing the wiki

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.700
 Make sure that you add random line breaks in various places. Right moving forwards to actual questions

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.100
 So Lou says

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.780
 Maybe not need specific, but what's heavier on an on a per item basis material orbs or material slots?

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.940
 So they're technically the same thing, right? So a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.820
 Material orb in Neos just refers back to the material that exists inside memory

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.340
 This actually occurs a lot more in Neos than you realize

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.700
 So in a lot of cases what we do is we create a 3d representation of an object to help you out

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.580
 Another example might be like a sound file or in some cases a picture as well

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.500
 That isn't the actual picture, but it's a reference to the picture within memory

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.900
 And then you can sort of you know

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.420
 Drag it around put it inside all the boxes and stuff that you need to make it work

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.060
 So that's all a material orb is but a material orb

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.960
 represents a material that is in memory and it will stay in memory in the world if it's being used and isn't cleaned up with

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960
 the the various cleanup options that we have

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.820
 So then it goes on to your answer about slots versus orbs so by material slots

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.580
 I think you're probably referring to the number of materials and mesh has in the mesh renderer component within the inspector now

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.100
 I don't quite know how rendering is handled

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.900
 But let's say you have an object that has two material slots and in each of those materials slots

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.900
 There is a completely different material

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.500
 What that means is in the rendering logic of whatever shade you're using and the engine itself, etc

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.920
 It has to do two calculations for that object rather than one

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.660
 I'm not it's thousands of calculations because you know light and the shit like that

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.340
 But like we know I mean, it's like two sets of calculations

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.020
 once for let's say the red material once for let's say the blue material and so that will

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.400
 double the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.660
 Sets of calculations that will do it depending on what type of material means the number of calculations, right?

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.100
 So there'll be two of them rather than one of them. So of course, that's that's worse in terms of performance

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.740
 I don't know what happens if you put the same material in

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.260
 in both slots

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.280
 Let's say you know

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.660
 like a door where the door frame is one material and the door itself is another material like a

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.280
 White door frame with like a wood colored door because you haven't painted it or whatever

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.740
 If that was two materials and then suddenly like well what if I did paint the door white, right?

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.000
 So then you put the white wood material in the in the wood material door slot

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.300
 I don't know what that would do to the draw calls because it still is technically two separate

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.760
 What's called like sub missions within the within the mesh?

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.020
 Yeah, they're also so spec says it would still incur a call

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.620
 I think that's the way it works as well because it's still there like it's still a separate

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.760
 Unit of work, I guess would be the term there is a button that says combine

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.580
 Slots of the same materials as a button there that will do that

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.980
 So Lou has expanded on their question by asking

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.820
 Mostly wondering because VRC's performance stats only count slots

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.280
 So having three slots of materials counts the same as having three slots and nine materials

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.040
 I would have to like go take a look at VR chats like calculation to figure that one out. I don't know

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.780
 What they're doing compared to what we're doing. All I know is that

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.720
 VRChat with like high safety settings and high performance

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.580
 Is not a fun place to be I was in a few worlds at the end of last week and

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.580
 It's crazy. It's like guys

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:47.160
 90% of the avatars in this world have been turned off because they were not like very poor

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.260
 They're poor right and they've been turned up like it's just crazy

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.700
 Atlitius stuff bake your blend shapes

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:00.500
 Atlitius textures, you know, okay. Let's move over to the next question here from rampur

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.260
 There is some giggles because I've answered this question like three or four times but it always comes up when a new device appears so

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.540
 rampur

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.500
 Alex via rampur via like basically the entire community wants to know will Neos come on to pick Pico Neo

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.200
 If you want Neos supported on a device

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.420
 Make github issue for that device and then all updates about that device will be on that issue

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.780
 so there is an issue already for the quest pro there's one I think for the

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.780
 Five I forget what it's called like not the like sunglasses one where you look like that guy from that film. I don't remember

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.780
 But the one where it's actually a headset that's got an issue

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.240
 I think the vajra has got an issue

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:53.020
 Like basically if you want a device supported make a github issue and then the gap issue will help you

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.840
 Sort of collate stuff

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.620
 The other thing it does of course is it means that if you're unsure or you don't know anything

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.380
 There's any updates in that you can just go to that issue. It's a little bit like, you know

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.720
 The whole check announcements thing but for devices specifically what it means is that we are

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.940
 Standardizing what we're saying about various devices by making sure that there is an issue there which we can then update

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.680
 So if you are wanting that device supported you can subscribe to that issue

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.060
 Make sure you get email notifications on if that issue is resolved

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.700
 Generically speaking, of course would like to be on every device

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.540
 But there's various reasons why that's not possible

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.180
 If you do make an issue make sure you get people that have that device or want to see that device supported to thumbs up

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.940
 And that will allow you to show support, you know as an example

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:40.620
 Let's say where we have budget in our development roadmap for one additional device to be supported and we see that one headset has

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.140
 100 thumbs up and one headset has one thumbs up

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.900
 You can probably guess what the conversation would be there

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.400
 Of course, we could overwrite that depending on technical specifics the complexity difficulty etc

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.040
 But hey a hundred people the community want this headset and one person wants this headset. It's kind of like, you know

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.720
 The other thing to remind people as well

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.400
 Is that like if you message any team member about any objective that you want them to achieve?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:13.220
 They'll probably forget it. They don't intend to they're just like busy

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.260
 So it's very important that you make sure that it is locked somewhere

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.560
 I log everything that people talk to me about because I know that they're lazy and that they won't make issues

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:27.140
 But we're all human we're gonna forget the best way to ensure that your answer is question

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.840
 Sorry, the feature is answered is to put in a geometry moving forwards

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.180
 Jackal says does the renderer prioritize based on what order the materials thoughts are in

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.080
 No, that would be based on the render queue setting

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:49.000
 Or is it render offset saying it's the one that's always negative one like that determines what's going on there

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.960
 So if it's negative one, it basically means like hey use your own best judgment and it will it'll slot in based on its attributes

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.600
 If you set a number there

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.180
 Then it will make sure that it is rendered there at a particular number set if that doesn't make sense

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.620
 I want you to think about transparency. So let's say that you had a

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.440
 let's just say like a

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.540
 Glass box, right?

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.120
 and so the the front of the box has got a piece of glass on it with a glass material and then the back of

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.680
 The box of the inside of the box is like I don't know that like plush velvet stuff. You see jewelry put in if

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.060
 it were to render the

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:29.240
 Transparent glass first it wouldn't know what's behind the glass. So it wouldn't be able to be like, oh, but what's behind the glass?

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:35.280
 So it usually will render the inside first and then the glass second because the glass has transparency it gets rendered

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.280
 After everything else in front of it or behind it

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.320
 Sharky and ask a question which says is there any

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.120
 Expressions built in some of the public avis are missing something lots of the public avatars will have expressions and gestures built into them

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.940
 I wouldn't know specifically unless you had one in mind and if you did have one in mind

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.500
 It's probably community made at which point it's like go ask the community member that made it

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.440
 We do have official avatars, of course in Neos Essentials

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.640
 They are just sort of

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:06.220
 Collections of avatars that we have the appropriate licenses to have in Neos Essentials some of those have gestures some of them don't again

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.960
 It's not something I can answer sort of

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.900
 Globally in a global level I can only answer it locally

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:19.220
 Okay, we go so Jackal asks, I know that we shouldn't use local timer local use of the timer node

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.360
 But could you direct local user?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.560
 Info into timer by the way of a button and have the timer node just applied to just the user press the button and all

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.000
 for the local system

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.680
 Do that with a variable

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:37.540
 So on button push write local user to a variable like whatever type of variable you want and then pass that into time

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.200
 I do that all the time

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.200
 funny pun

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.280
 I have lots of things that need to sort of have a

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.120
 particular user involved and

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.940
 You know, they need to what's the word I'm trying to look for? I'm lost on English for a second

00:10:53.940 --> 00:11:01.340
 when running scientific experiments data gathering or even sometimes games or experiences or even sometimes like just an

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:09.040
 Object you want to make sure that the user that is running the timer node the updates the rights the web requests, etc

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.360
 Is a specific user so I'm often making gadgets tools worlds, etc

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.880
 Where there is a dynamic variable that is used every single time you need a user. It's just like world

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.760
 The user world the user that matters world boss person

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.600
 You know and then that way everything runs based on them

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.000
 Nitra says our new github issues actually being looked at by linear's team. Basically, none of them are getting official responses

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 I look at every single issue

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.400
 Yeah, I look every single issue because it's cool

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.440
 It's like it's it's bad when you like say it's not bad bad wrong word

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.220
 It's like it's confusing when people say that they don't have official responses because it's like the official responses

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.280
 We can give to an issue are we are going to work on this. We are working on this

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.800
 We are not going to work on this. We have done this all questions, right?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.780
 And so because of the current situation see the announcements channel blah blah blah. I don't talk about it

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.240
 It's difficult to respond to any of those they get looked at though

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.760
 But beyond that even if they were not looked at it's better that they're written down

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.000
 Because the team will forget if they're not written down

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.960
 So it's not like it's not the best case scenario, of course, you know

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.120
 It gets implemented immediately when you have an issue, but it's better than your issue being forgotten

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.440
 So it's the better of of like two evils is the wrong word

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:36.160
 But it's the better occurrence compared to it being forgotten. It is better to put it in an issue. I need to vacuum anyway, um

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:43.240
 Shrikey says the valleys are the main ones I use and here's some PLC and some tablet computers. I'm sure they are licensed

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.560
 Um, I can't keep up with the valley community. There are so many different bases models

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.120
 adjustments

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.160
 Kit bashes rips copy pasters politics and drama etc

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.400
 I'm not like I said, I'm not up-to-date on this but at one point

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:07.820
 I think that there was a creator annoyed because another creator had made a novalli base and was releasing it for free and it was

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.780
 better than the one that was paid previously or something and it's just like

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:19.960
 the only thing that can be charged for money in the sort of world of avatar creation is

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.760
 uniqueness or

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.160
 Like customized work so talking like test textures clothing, etc

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.280
 If someone comes along and makes like a very similar, but of course not identical

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:39.160
 Inspired version of that character then I don't think you have license to it. The only exception there would be if the

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:46.320
 Licensing to the original character the original of Ali was locked down which I believe at one point it was

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.640
 But then you can sort of say like well, it's not an avali

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.680
 It's like this other space bird and if you don't agree with that

00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:00.680
 I just want you to look at every single video game has a pig in it and wonder if a furry had decided that the pig

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.920
 Avatar base was theirs and no one else could use a pig then

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.760
 Minecraft would be on the hook any other video game that has a pig would be on the hook because you know

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.080
 It's it's a pig

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.840
 You want a simpler version of that if I tell you to imagine an apple and you imagine a nice apple in your head

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.520
 The original like owner of the Apple doesn't isn't doesn't own that right?

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.820
 You can't it's just weird

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.560
 anyway

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.080
 Not legal advice. Please seek legal advice in a jurisdiction of your choosing

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.960
 but if you would like to

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:40.120
 Figure out which of the avali bases you can use or has gestures or something like that

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.100
 I would encourage you to ask a mentor the mentors have a bunch of resources which will

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:52.240
 They're basically sort of various avatars that are set up have the appropriate licenses to be shared and some of them might have

00:14:52.720 --> 00:15:00.420
 Gestures or etc so Lord buckethead asks when can you see new six manning popularity only once our current issues are fixed?

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.620
 Yeah, moving forwards to

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:09.280
 Jackals question. What is your next tutorial going to be about well? I don't know

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.400
 I'm a bit busy with life right now

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.000
 I need to get a new employment set up, and I'm also changing apartments funny thing about this right so

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.120
 I live on a big apartment communities. That's like really expensive and

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.120
 If I move like it's literally the building next door

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.060
 It's like a grand cheaper and pretty much the same thing

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.180
 I don't know what's happening with this like area

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.500
 I live in but like it might be where I like I ring up a mover and I go like hey

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:44.980
 Hey, hey guys. I need a you know a one-bed apartment move. They're like oh how far you go number three steps

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.580
 They're just like what?

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.920
 You might as well not bring like a truck you might as well

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:57.380
 Just like bring some dollies and help me like the couch would probably be the couch of the bed would probably be the most awkward ones

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.600
 To move everything else is just gonna be like put it in a box put it on a dolly

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.660
 We'll it three steps out the back door and into the front door of the other place. Let's go

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.500
 but yeah, that will save like a grander month, which is

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.220
 Anyway um

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:19.020
 Hence why that'll probably be my next tutorial is how to how to contact a moving company and explain that you want to move

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.980
 two meters to the left

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:29.040
 Moving on to Rob's question Rob who says does need to support custom mesh to form as a bend to form for example

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.620
 I'd like to create a machine learning to form with the estimates custom character deformations for a different 3d package

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:38.940
 No, we don't support any of that you might be able to add something like that with a plugin

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.940
 But we don't support any of that currently

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.580
 Yes, that is true. I mean like the plugin page

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.860
 So ramp was saying that plugins will prevent you from connecting to sessions where users do not have that plugin

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.900
 That is correct here is the plugins page

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:59.460
 Rob also are saying ideas for implementing chat GPT agents into the world you need to use the HD

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:13.380
 Sorry you need to use the HTTP nodes to get that sort of probably you probably also like to do something over web sockets because

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.380
 It is chat, but I would probably

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.940
 suggest

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.940
 HTTP instead

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:25.060
 Many people have done that you'd have to look around in the community. I'm sure someone can help you out. I haven't done it

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.060
 I actually don't recommend it either

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.460
 Not because it isn't cool or isn't applications for it. I just like

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:39.700
 Personal take on chat GPT is completely overboard overblown and out of proportion it guesses the next letter or word in a sentence

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.980
 That's it

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.660
 so

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.660
 It isn't accurate basically

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:52.020
 It'll look like it is but then it isn't so it's crazy like that people are relying on it to write code and things like that

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.660
 I just always feel that's weird like how much detail you're looking at and making sure that this is like the most optimal code or

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.060
 The best secure code. I don't know anyway moving onwards to Risa's question

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.300
 But doing a lot of baked blender animations, and I keep finding myself something in a strange rotation issue

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.820
 That's new to appear in Neos but not in blender

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.860
 I really don't know what the cause is but my something to do with interpolated quarter

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:18.180
 Quaternion rotation I can't show any pointers on baking imported baked machines only in my correct having them animate correctly I

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:24.760
 Don't know and now the reason I don't know is because periodically we will find a a quaternarian

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.940
 Problem so there was this mop

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.380
 Many years ago. He was like a year or so ago

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.840
 There was a mop which I try to import from sketchfab and the mop would just look wrong

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.120
 It was just wrong like like bits were rotated weirdly

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:44.500
 That got fixed and then earth mark was using an avatar where I can't reverse the left or right leg

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.940
 But one of their legs was just sort of like rotated in such a way that it just didn't make any sense

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.500
 And so now there's actually a test in

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:58.860
 Our like test code for mathematics which is annotated as the flamingo leg test

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.300
 And it's designed to sort of make sure that that leg problem never reoccurs I

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.900
 Don't know about looking into into what's going on there. I haven't had that experience

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.940
 We have baked animations that I've been doing, but I've only really been doing

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:20.080
 Like character based animations from XMO and stuff like that so that might be why because I don't know like characters are like a known

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.800
 Good path compared to maybe like you know other more complex animations like this is like mechanical stuff

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.800
 I don't know. He always I know

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.580
 Could always make a good issue

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.820
 With you know a log file and a sample blender that we can take a look at

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:42.780
 Shaky says what is the Neos coin going to be back in my builds and it came back at suspended, okay?

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.740
 It is in live builds. It is in the standalone light bill. It cannot be in the steam build

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.820
 It is not allowed to be in the steam build by steam if the Neos coin was in the steam build

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.540
 Then we wouldn't have a steam build so there's your answer to that if you only use the Neos coin

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.860
 You can use the standalone it's all the questions. I have on the list so

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.460
 Any additional questions, please get them through always will be ending off in about three minutes or three minutes

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:13.180
 Any additional questions? I always apologize like at some point like I know I'm basically saying like make stuff on the github a lot

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:18.380
 But truly I will forget these questions at some point or if on the github

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.620
 There's a lesser chance that I will forget. That's a good chatty question. Thanks Lord buckethead

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.780
 So buckethead asks do you have any personal favorite worlds in Neos?

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:33.180
 I like worlds which are break the norm and the reason why I say break the norm is we have a metaverse engine but

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:40.140
 predominantly the largest category of worlds I see are social worlds followed by a game worlds and

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.900
 While social worlds are great. There's only so many like cushions string lights

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:52.420
 Soft lighting and mirrors that I can take before they all start looking the same for example over in in VR chat

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.380
 There's I don't know like 500 or so

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.860
 Club worlds there's the black cat which I can see here

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.100
 They're the black cats sort of a more upmarket pub compared to the great pug

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:12.860
 But functionally the great pug and the black cat are the same and then there's like cozy rooftop something something

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:19.540
 There's about five of those are all named cozy rooftop something something the pattern there is just tons of cushions and string lights

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:24.700
 So I get kind of like worn out on social worlds what I like in terms of worlds is anything

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.580
 That is not a social world and in some cases in a game, but

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:34.100
 What I mean in terms of games go to the game was I want something which is an experience

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.580
 I see a lot of games where it feels a bit like an arcade machine, right you play the game

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.580
 As though you're playing an arcade machine, but like we're in virtual reality

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:50.040
 So I'd like to see game worlds where I feel like I am in that world like a higher sense of immersion or something like that

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.380
 example might be the MMC folks who made the

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:59.060
 Transfer and the one where you swapped bodies. I'm sorry. I don't remember the name

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:06.780
 Transference transistence something like that that was transpose there we go. I knew it was trans something that was like an experience

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.860
 That was an experience right which sort of like it went beyond the sort of

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.380
 What I mean by arcade is let's think like murder for example

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.120
 Murder is a round based game and when you get to the end of the round everything resets

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.640
 And if you think of it like an arcade all right put another quarter in that machine whereas

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.940
 Transpose it's like hey

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.660
 This is a whole experience when you get to the end of that experience your life is

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.340
 Better is the wrong word your life has been enriched by that experience

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:39.020
 That comes from mostly my might my love of what I call like exploration based puzzle games

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:44.100
 When I say I like puzzle games to people they're like oh like Sudoku, and I'm like I mean yeah

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.640
 I could do Sudoku every now and again

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:51.040
 But that's not what I mean what I mean is like the puzzle isn't Morse code

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.060
 a

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.060
 five-digit pin code on a door

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.740
 I

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.340
 Read blue or green involved please don't use colors in your puzzle maps

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:05.220
 But it's like not only are you solving the puzzle of the puzzle that you're facing

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.660
 But you're also solving the puzzle of the world like what is this world was this world want me to feel

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.820
 What is this world want me to experience so you can look at games such as?

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.220
 The mysteries for that

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.020
 Quern is another good example

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.760
 Duction as well, I'm just listening science at this point

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.500
 If your game was made by cyan yes

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.780
 No, there's a steam curator. I like when it comes to games

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:37.140
 I know I've like drifted away from the actual topic which was you know worlds inside news, but like think about making an experience

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.780
 Over making a place for an experience to occur in so social worlds

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.700
 They're made for an experience to occur and that experience might be hanging out with friends and having a good time

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:53.660
 Perfectly fine perfectly suitable. There's nothing wrong with them, but what I want to see is VR world that gives me an experience

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:59.120
 By itself if that made any sense thumbs up. I'll now check other questions

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.500
 Speaking of cyan their next game comes out in

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:08.320
 About five days ish five six days. I'll be gone. I'll be playing that

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.600
 Of course I'll still be doing any work. I need to be doing but

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.060
 We've like that. It's it's it's a big. They would be amazing. I think it's got PR. I'm not sure I can't remember

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:25.020
 Yeah, I've been waiting on that forever to the point where I forgot it existed and the something like it's releasing next week like okay

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.220
 No need to yell moving on to a question which we have from Lou

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:36.540
 They say is there a different reason KFC which from my listening is a useless currency without a real-world value is blocked on steam bills

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.780
 It's just because it's built on the same part as in CR

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:44.200
 KFC is what we call a canary so if you're not familiar with the terminology of canary

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.760
 miners used to take canaries which are just small birds down into the coal mines with them and

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.960
 The canary would die in a response to any sort of toxic gas before the miners would

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.460
 This is before we had some things like gas detectors or health meters or even oxygen tanks or stuff like this

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:05.520
 So they know if the canary died they should get out of the coal mine because it was dangerous

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.760
 And they did that's to come forwards into the sort of software design world as if you want a canary

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:17.740
 It's if the canary broke something is very very broken. So KFC is a canary for NCR. So

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.020
 Its entire existence is just to test NCR related functionality

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:28.540
 And so it is pretty much like a copy/paste of it's not a copy/paste if you think you know technology or programming

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:33.020
 Well, you know, it's not a copy/paste its configuration and stuff like that. But for the layman's terms

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:38.060
 It's a copy/paste of the NCR code. And so we have code which says if we are a steam belt

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.700
 Disable NCR, but it's not disabled NCR. It's disabled any type of token

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.620
 And so it just naturally kills KFC as well

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:51.660
 And if it didn't kill KFC then KFC as a canary wouldn't work as a canary

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.560
 So that's the reason why it's it's sort of linked. That was a long

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.540
 Wibbly-wobbly explanation I apologize beyond that

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.220
 It would be easy for KFC to be mistaken

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:13.900
 So, you know a steam store review person for the policy could look at KFC and mistake it for NCR quite easily

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:19.180
 And you know just how serious it was they were like, nope, we're taking you off steam. You've got crypto in you

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.920
 We're taking you off steam. That's like how hard and fast they were about it

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.860
 So we didn't want to give them any reason to say you still have crypto

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:32.940
 Even though we don't in the steam boat, of course. Yeah, KFC is just testing right?

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:38.900
 It's the exact same code the exact same flow the exact same UI. It's just got no real-world value

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.420
 People have given it value

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:46.900
 There's like casinos that use it. There's experiences that use it, etc. It's just testing with that

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.700
 I believe we're gonna leave off as we're at 35 past

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:57.060
 So let's go ahead and close off things and I will speak to you next week. I am very far behind on notes

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.380
 I was having some issues with whisper which is our

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.860
 thing that

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.260
 transcribes them based on stuff which

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:10.740
 Lexivr built so thank you much to them for their services and building the tooling

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:16.700
 But sometimes it just I'll leave it running for like three hours and I'll tab back and it's broken

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:23.180
 That's not Lex's fault. That's just whisper crashing or something. I've got to look into it. I have just finished

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.500
 I just looked last week's was just transcribed in text

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.580
 So that'll go up along with the one before the vacation I had and then I'll get this one transcribed me as soon as I can

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.940
 I'll post here when I've got them up to date. I know it's a problem

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:39.100
 I know I keep falling behind but I'll do my best and I will speak to you again soon
