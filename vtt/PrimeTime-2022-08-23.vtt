WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
So, welcome to Office Hours, it is 4pm now, so we're going to go ahead and get started.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.720
If you have questions, anything you want to know or ask about Neos, please drop it in

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.480
the Office Hours text chat that's above the one that you're currently in, and I'll answer

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.700
it in the order that they appear.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.700
Any questions that you have.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.900
We have two currently, so I'll go ahead and get started with those two questions.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.900
So firstly from Aragibus, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, but I don't think I am.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.120
They said, how does Neos manage the downloaded assets?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.960
Downloaded assets are stored in what's called your cache.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.220
If you go to the following link, which I have just been working on today actually, it talks

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.320
about the locations of both of those folders, because sometimes those get confused.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.480
There's two folders, there's the cache, which stores temporary copies of assets downloaded

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.440
when you're using Neos, and the database, stroke, data folder, which stores a local

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.000
copy of items and things that you are saving.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.720
So do keep those two changes in mind.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.080
So they're downloaded to your cache, and that's simply so that you don't have to download

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080
them again.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.520
Let's say, for example, you join a Neos session every single day with your best friend, and

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.040
they have a particular avatar.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.000
You don't want to download the avatar every single day, so we save it to your cache so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.960
we can pick it up from that cache if you have it, because your friend loads faster.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.480
That's also why, if you see new people, their avatars will load slower, because you don't

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.960
have them in your cache.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.720
Moving forward to screen, this question, what can you tell us about future updates?

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.840
I have nothing to tell you about future updates.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.680
There's a bunch of stuff that is obviously always being worked on.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.720
For those who are like, the Neos team are on strike.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.640
If I was on strike, would I really be sat here with 32 people listening to me and answering

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.640
questions?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.560
We're still doing stuff, but for future updates, we have no announcements.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.920
Please do check the announcements channel for any updates on that whole mess.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.200
There we go, we're out of questions.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.800
And Adia Shark has just trumped that route of questions with a question, which is totally

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
fine.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800
That's the point of this situation.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800
They are asking, does the cache have auto-clearing?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.840
It doesn't currently, and that does lead to the cache sort of inflating a lot.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.960
Feel free to clear the cache.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.920
Do not clear the database or data folder, though, if you can help it.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.400
Feel free to clear the cache whenever you would like.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.480
I am aware of other techniques and things that will clear the cache.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.140
Some people have got, like, batch jobs or sort of scheduled tasks or things like that.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.920
Some people have got calendar alerts to go clear it.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.480
Some people even got mods, which they have created or installed, which will do it for

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480
them automatically.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.280
It is entirely up to you, though.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.680
The cache is also stored within a file system within Windows, if you're on Windows here,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.500
that is designed for temporary files as well.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.440
So some applications and some parts of Windows will clear that temporary directory for you.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440
That's why it's in there.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.400
The temporary directory is, like, explicitly, if a developer is using that folder, they

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.920
know explicitly that the stuff in there cannot always be guaranteed to be in there.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.160
That's the point of the temporary folder.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.360
The other operating systems, such as Linux, et cetera, they also have a temporary directory,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.400
but I don't know much about those, it's been a while since I've been on Linux.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.520
I think that is an ideas question, so moving on to arugabuses again.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.800
They have another question, which is some parts of NEEA cannot be translated, where

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800
do I report that?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.480
Go to the NEEA's locale for, like, a GitHub issue, sorry, a GitHub repository, and make

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.480
an issue there.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.480
Try not to make an issue for, like, everything that can't be translated, because we'll be

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.160
there for, like, forever, but if there's something there that you feel would be good to be translated,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.220
do put it there.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.320
Things that are not suitable to go there are things like logic nodes, we don't have the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.880
capability to translate those yet, but if there's just, like, a loose floating string

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.920
that exists somewhere, we can probably get that translated.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.820
A good example being, I was working on the just months and months ago, but I was working

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.660
on the create directory dialogue, that's when you, like, create a directory in your inventory,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.400
and I realized it was not translatable, and it was easy.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.480
It was, like, another couple of lines of code to expose translation strings for that, so

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480
I did that.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.840
I did that because I was touching that code.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.160
So do keep that in mind.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.580
It's not, like, intentional, it's just, like, to update it such that it's translatable,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.200
we have to touch it, and if it's a complicated string, such as logics, then we need to do

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.040
a lot of work to make it translatable, hence why logic is not translatable.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.360
Translation gets complicated sometimes.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.240
Moving forwards to Cole's question, which says, what do you think of user management

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.320
systems, logic that puts each user in their own slot and tries to keep things they spawn

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.240
within them, do you advise against having these pre-installed in published worlds?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.520
I advise you have them in pre-installed in published worlds, they're fantastic at controlling

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.280
the craziness which is people's disrespect of your world.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280
That's truly what it is sometimes.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.560
I mean, it's not usually, but, like, sometimes it is.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.760
Like, I go in worlds sometimes, and there's just, like, a absolute tidal wave of crap

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.520
in the world that people have just left and forgotten.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.720
Clean up after yourself, please.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.160
If you spawn a gun that you're no longer using, don't just drop it in the world.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.600
Clean it up.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.600
For creators as well, the best thing you can do to be compatible with those systems is

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.800
to go ahead and use the local user space node rather than the root slot node whenever you're

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.280
re-parenting something.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.240
It is literally a, you won't notice the difference from a creating point of view 99% of the time.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.840
Just swap uses of the root slot node with the local user space node and you'll be good.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.160
Local user space node refers to the slot which a user is parented to and not the root slot.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.800
So if you created a world management system where Colza spawns in the world, they get

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.820
their own slot, they get parented to it.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.480
If Colza's object uses parent with root slot, it would parent, I don't know, weapons, arrows,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.720
grenades to the root slot.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.840
But if it used local user space, all of their weapons, arrows, grenades, et cetera, would

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.920
be parented to the Colza user slot, enabling a world management system to clean up effectively

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.360
once they were gone.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.080
And then, again, just for reiteration, clean up after yourself, please, like, please.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.640
I feel like I should, like, meme it a little bit more, like, get a 3D model of a toy chest

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.360
and just, like, put it in the world and, like, put a user management system in there and

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.540
detect when there's more than, like, 20 items abandoned in a user's slot, like, spawn a

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.000
toy chest and be like, it's time to tidy up.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.120
Like, with a gif of me waggling my finger or something.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.320
It's time to tidy up, poor waggles finger.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.440
Or you'll go on the naughty step.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.800
Moving forwards, Zafford being says, dumb question.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.920
There are zero questions in the entirety of this Discord which are dumb.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.800
If you have asked the same question every single day for an entire year, someone will

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
answer you.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800
It's not dumb.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.000
Like, Neos is complicated.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We all learning together.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.920
Let's make sure that we get that correct.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.160
The question that they're asking is, do you need to port forward to stream to Twitch inside

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.160
of Neos?

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.160
No.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.640
You don't need to port forward to do most things inside Neos.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.280
You can change some of your network settings to be a little bit easier to join to from

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.520
other users, but we do have systems in place that mean you don't really need to port forward

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.520
at all.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.440
If you're having a particular issue with Twitch-related streaming stuff, please go ahead and ask it

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.440
more directly.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.840
Rigibus has another question here, which is, is the free 25GB storage still available for

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.280
people who make locales?

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.560
I don't know.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.920
I noticed yesterday that the locale repository had a little bit of neglect going on there,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.080
which is understandable because we're not currently doing updates, but what kind of

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.640
like tugged at my heartstrings, if you like, to make me kind of fix that yesterday was

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.680
I noticed that two separate people had translated properly, as in a manual translation rather

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.160
than a machine translation, the game into Chinese.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.040
And I thought, if we've got two people doing that substantial work, then we just need to

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.040
handle it.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.440
So I merged all applicable mergers that could be merged just so that we didn't have that

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.440
happen again.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.580
I don't want people doing potentially weeks' worth of work that we're then accidentally

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.580
ignoring.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.400
Even if we don't intend to sort of make an update right now, we can at least say like,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.280
hey, the Chinese translation has been done once, maybe work together on improving it,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.280
but don't do it separately.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.280
But it seems like that's what actually happened.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:50.080
Two people separately did the translation from scratch and I'm just like, ah, that shouldn't

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.520
be bad.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.520
That shouldn't happen.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.520
That's, that's like a waste of time.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.360
Oh, they'll, they'll resolve it, I'm sure.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360
All right, moving onwards.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.000
We have a question from Thermo.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.640
Is there a BeeHaptics integration?

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.640
Yes.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.980
BeeHaptics is entirely integrated into the game.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.560
You just need to make sure that the BeeHaptics software is on and running, that you've tested

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.560
it.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.880
You've got buzzes on your BeeHaptics stuff before you launch Neos and then it will be

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.440
in there and working.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.900
The problem that you might have with the BeeHaptics integration though is that not a lot of stuff

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.200
inside Neos supports it from a development point of view inside the game.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.040
Inside the game, objects need to basically say, hey, I would like to be BeeHaptics.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.720
I would like to be a BeeHaptics dut ad.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.200
Please buzz haptics when they come near you.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.920
It should by default work with other people's hands so they can like touch poke, you know,

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.520
prod you, et cetera.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.480
But you can also make objects work with BeeHaptics.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.220
If you'd like an example of that, I have tutorial videos on my channel or you can go ahead and

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.300
visit Sojourner's Island made by the Neos team, which has a bunch of haptics integrations

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.280
that are, you know, it's actually an event to sort of showcase that we had BeeHaptics.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.600
It is not OSC and we do not have OSC support.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.360
Moving forward, Specs says, I would very much like to add port forwarding to my router to

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.700
make it easier for users to join me.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.040
What port range would I need for that?

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.420
It's not port forwarding.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.420
It's a NAT type.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.520
If you go to the wiki, I'll get the link in just a second.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.360
The networking information page has some information about that.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.260
It's just making sure that your NAT settings are good.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.800
We are like, it's 2022.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.120
No one should be like manually port forwarding unless I don't know they're playing like Half

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.540
Life or something.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:34.000
There's a setting right at the bottom there of recommended here we go American versus

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.160
British in my brain.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.560
I live in America, but I'm British.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.760
Recommended router configuration or if you're American, recommended router configuration.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.720
Both is like good and fine.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.560
Strangely enough, British people will call the tool thing and you know that you do for

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.600
woodwork or whatever, the router there, we will call that a router.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.480
For anything else, it's root or router.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.480
It's very confusing.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.240
Yeah, I went to a woodworking class once and we got that, the router, and I'm like, oh,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
okay.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.320
And I was very confused when people started talking about routers, I'm like, why do people

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.240
plug in this woodworking tool to their Internet?

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.960
That doesn't make any sense.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.960
Very interesting, though.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:18.240
Moving forwards, Stifle says I was curious about the answer to this question back on

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:25.000
October 21st, 2019, oh, deary me, let's get out some sepia-toned cameras and stuff.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.140
You made a tutorial with segment mesh and slot segment mesh and asked why can't slot

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.620
segment mesh be collapsed into segment mesh and later stated that would be a question

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.240
for the NEOS team, since you are part of the NEOS team after the video was made, what was

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.760
the answer to the almost three-year-old question?

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:45.320
There are a lot of cases where accidentally for in some cases very valid reasons, but

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.920
for some cases just sort of like either a combination of forgetful reasons or just time

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.060
pressure, different things have been created that really don't need to exist and they need

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.120
to be sort of collated back together.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.800
I was trying to think of that word, collate, I was thinking staple, but no, staple and

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.700
collate, collate is the word I was looking for.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.400
So slot segment mesh and segment mesh are a good example of that.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.120
As are our myriad of PBS shaders, Geens wants to eventually collapse all of those into one

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.640
PBS shader with all of the settings exposed in a way that makes sense, such that we don't

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.760
have like we have so much duplicate code for PBS rendering in our shader files, it's sort

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.760
of crazy.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.640
Another example where I want to do it is the axis aligner aligner components.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.960
They all work completely differently from a technical point of view, I mean from a functional

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.720
point of view as well, they do different alignments, but from a technical point of view, it seems

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.080
none of them can agree about the best way to update themselves, the axis aligner does

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.640
it in a way that is not performant, the object grid aligner does it in a way that is performant

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.040
or isn't, I can't really remember.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.320
It would be great if we could just sort of collapse all that together into an aligner

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.840
component, which then had a method that would also allow additional methods for alignment

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.960
to be sort of written well.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.720
That's a really good example of sort of refactoring where we talk about that sometimes, it's like

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.440
what if this was one component that had a method of alignment and then it'd be a lot

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.680
easier to sort of establish that the behavior was consistent across all of those components

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.000
rather than vastly different because they all work differently for some reason.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.040
Moving forwards, Zafford's got back to me with a question.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.520
They say when I go to a WebSocket plugin and try to connect it to Neos, it all says disconnected

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.720
even though as far as where the ipm port is correct, ah okay, double check which version

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.260
of the WebSocket plugin that you are using.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:32.740
There is a complicated matter that is unfolding, basically OBS WebSocket the plugin just rolled

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:39.100
over to version 5 and version 5 is not compatible with Neos currently.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.100
That is like probably like the highest priority in terms of like my tutorial item that I'll

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:49.600
be fixing when I'm able to because 5 is incompatible with earlier versions of the OBS WebSocket

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600
protocol.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:57.880
Additionally, for added insults to injury, OBS Studio versions which are greater than

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.840
I don't know right now I think it's like I don't know the number but they will by default

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.960
include OBS WebSocket in them so if you have downloaded and installed OBS Studio from the

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:13.620
website like within the past sort of few weeks it'll probably have OBS WebSocket 5 installed

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.880
in it so you'll go ahead and have to replace that with a version before 5 and then it will

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.940
work if it's 5 or later it will not work.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:28.260
If you are running OBS on the same computer that you are running Neos on to use it you

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.080
don't need to change the port or IP address settings I have not changed those since 2019

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.080
they just work.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.000
You also don't need port forwarding because if it's a local connection doesn't matter

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.760
it's just like oh that's me that's my computer whoop and it just connects it doesn't need

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.760
to go out to the network.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:48.140
All right moving onwards Dark Witch Dreams welcome to the community because they only

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.640
just recently joined that's why I'm saying welcome.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.720
Sometimes I should read and then answer but sometimes I just like read and answer at the

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.420
same time.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.960
They hope that this question is okay for the conversation there are not many questions

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.680
that are not okay for the conversation if they're not okay it's not like you've done

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.160
something wrong it's just like hey I'm not the right person to ask but I'm sure that

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.800
this question I haven't read yet is perfectly fine.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.540
They jumped into Neos they haven't jumped into Neos yet and the big reason is just how

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.200
large and overwhelming it seems on top of the social anxiety is there somewhere you

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.800
can point me that or I should start to have it be less overwhelming yes a good way to

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:30.220
start and not be overwhelming is to make a couple of sacrifices but these are good sacrifices

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.920
so sacrifice one is pick an avatar that's already in the game don't think about importing

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.880
your VRChat avatar if you've come from VRChat or whatever avatar just pick one that's in

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.000
the game and then number two is don't build.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.640
We get a lot of sort of questions and comments about like why don't you have a non-building

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.760
mode right you'd go to the start of Neos and you'd hit play and say like I want to build

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.440
I don't want to build the really only difference between those two versions of the game would

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.960
be we would disable the ability for you to open up the building UI but strangely you

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:04.120
can do that yourself with a mentality shift right you can say I don't want to build therefore

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.320
I won't spawn the inspector tip or the logics tip I won't spawn those and I don't want to

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.460
build and then you can just sit in front of a mirror if that's what you're doing watch

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.600
videos whatever you want to do you don't have to build and then that will make it viral

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.000
vastly vastly less overwhelming you pick an avatar that's already in the game and then

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.240
you just don't build and then it should be less overwhelming because you don't need to

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:29.160
learn anything there you should you should just you know chill out watch videos and hang

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.320
out with people you may have some difficulty finding open sessions that are not technical

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.540
that's something that I wish our community culture could change about majority sessions

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.440
you go into someone if they're not talking about technical matters to do with Neos they're

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.080
talking about technical matters to do with just like other stuff you know go in there

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.740
and they're just like well I heard the Nvidia 380 is better than the 390 like the parallelization

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.280
of the neutron floating into the flux capacitor and you're just like yeah I'm inebriated and

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.920
I just want to like lie in front of a mirror and watch videos like it's sometimes difficult

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:07.600
to get that kind of setup so there you go at the point where you want an avatar set

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.880
up if you know that you're going to struggle or be overwhelmed it might be worth sort of

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.240
booking time with a mentor there's no official way to do this but if you find someone with

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:22.560
a funny green badge in the discord or in game you could say like hey Tuesday 3 p.m would

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.680
you help me get the avatar set up for me and do most of the work for me because I don't

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.920
want to get overwhelmed and they'd be happy to sort that out right they'll need some files

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.500
from you of course to get it done but like they'll take care of it for you there's always

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:41.400
two ways of learning in Neos and it's great if you're explicit with a mentor about your

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.040
intentions there I've seen both of them and especially with the recent sort of uptick

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.540
in players there are players who are like can you help me set up my avatar and show

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.960
me how to do it or can you help me set up my avatar because I want to be comfortable

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.880
in Neos those are two different scenarios like they don't want to know how it works

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.200
they just want an avatar that they're comfortable with and then once they're comfortable maybe

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.200
they'll have an opportunity to learn but they don't necessarily need to have the opportunity

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.560
to learn they don't necessarily want to learn and both of those are okay usually in other

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.040
circles such as like learning programming that's not okay like if you went to like I

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.360
don't know a learning programming community on discord and you're like could someone write

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.080
code for me would be like no because you won't learn but like if it's your avatar totally

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.640
understandable you just want to feel comfortable inside the game someone will help you out

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:32.440
we have lots of insight from from from mentors there holy's fantastic froppy who is a mentor

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.360
and a moderator so they've got like all the not as many badges as me but like all the

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.520
badges they're very helpful as well as link is very helpful specs as well like everyone's

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.040
helpful here just just ask questions yeah yeah yeah you've not managed to complete the

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.360
collection there froppy if you get on the team you'll still be missing one yeah it does

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.920
it does unfortunately sound like jumping in is the best start but just jump in with with

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.560
that mindset right the mindset being i don't need to build and i can use one of the existing

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.400
avatars and then just like have an explore uh no you don't uh learn things you should

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.320
go is a good way of looking at or don't but if you just like i don't want to learn totally

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.760
fine it's totally fine uh i reckon best has another question here which is what is the

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.520
mobile friendly toggle it's right i'm giggling not because of the question but because of

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:27.680
of that checkbox um so that checkbox is uh basically like a little sign um that has no

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:33.520
validation or features or functionality about it at all if you turn that on you are basically

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.120
raising a little sign that says i'm a mobile friendly session and whether you actually

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.440
are a mobile friendly session or not um doesn't matter so it's the equivalent of basically

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.160
you know standing outside of a coffee shop and saying we have free coffee and then you

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.160
go inside the coffee shop and they don't actually have free coffee it just it doesn't mean anything

00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:01.560
uh we did want it to mean something originally it just it just didn't you know uh it is crazy

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:07.440
there it's also sort of paired with checkboxes that actually do do stuff do do lol for example

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.600
the unsafe mode checkbox will enable unsafe mode and that does actually make stuff happen

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:18.360
um for those who are worried about unsafe mode it's quite difficult to make unsafe mode

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.920
not safe counter to its name but the moment you check unsafe mode it will force your session

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:29.040
to lan only um you can thank me for unsafe mode um i caused it to happen let's see what

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.440
we've got uh for other questions here oh gina hello uh i've been loading sessions that are

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.680
taking a lot more time uh than a year ago any recommendations or tips to optimize world

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.360
loading in assets near spawn first there is nothing um that you can do to optimize uh

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.960
the order in which my assets load in right now um if you're having slowness we do actually

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.700
have an issue open for assets loading slowly um there is a sort of community fix for that

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.520
which is to just clear your cache but i don't understand why that makes assets load faster

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.760
but hey maybe it'll work for you um but that might speed it up but no we have no load control

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.800
right now um even if you have stuff like disabled checkbox wise or like culling zone wise it's

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:13.160
still got a load it's just it's a problem we got to like fix it somehow later uh arabis

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.960
if you asked 500 000 questions i would answer them all and be totally happy with that so

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.680
don't don't don't feel bad about that this is this is question time if you answer you

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:32.560
ask one fantastic if you ask 50 fantastic the poop poop poop poop poop uh that is the

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:38.940
cash slinker if it's in local temp solarax neos that's the cash oh if you're forcing

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:46.500
the cache path argument um sometimes the app path the other one will still refer to the

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.460
old cache path in its saved settings which means that even though you've done cache path

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:57.260
it won't listen to it which is really annoying um and actually caused me to just rewrite

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:03.600
the uh relocate neos folder guide again because i'm like wait a moment the only real way to

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.440
make sure that data path and cache path are listened to in their entirety is to nuke everything

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.180
and start again both cache and data that's the only way to make sure that they are listened

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.740
to so that's probably what's going on there with slinker's issue um it looks like a rigor

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.820
versus question about scaling working on desktop is uh answered uh froppy says it's control

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.400
shift and mouse wheel for scaling enabled that will scale you on desktop um i'm seeing

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.660
a lot of comments on my youtube videos about this as well um so i want to state it as well

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:37.120
there should be no reason why features work strangely between our platforms that aren't

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.560
stated somewhere so i had a comment which is like i guess publishing worlds on linux

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.920
doesn't work no no publishing worlds on linux should work if it doesn't that's a bug please

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.360
provide a log if you're listening i did comment on the the youtube comment with that as well

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.360
and then someone else said is it known that logics doesn't work on the dix i'm like no

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.860
no logics should work on the dix if you're having an issue please let me know let's figure

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:04.120
it out um froppy says the arugopus uh said that scaling objects doesn't work only scales

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.000
one time and stops working well i'm on desktop right now so if you just give me a second

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.520
um i will go ahead and see if i can reproduce that so i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna create

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.760
a new 3d model box and i know you can't see this i'm just describing what i'm doing to

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.560
fill dead a time and i'm moving it around and i've made it smaller with scale and i'm

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.080
letting go of it and i'm going to grab it again and i'm making it bigger if you can

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.740
describe the exact sequence of button pushes you're doing it might be that it also might

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.840
be uh just something to do with the actual object that you're scaling do remember that

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.520
certain objects cannot be scaled by design it's actually a checkbox that you can enable

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.460
on the object and uh if it's not enabled there's usually a good reason for it although sometimes

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.720
there isn't a reason for it and someone's just forgotten to check that on let's move

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:51.240
forwards um agro force says is there a way to drag stuff around in your dash in screen

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.000
mode i don't know i've never been able to get ui edit mode to work in screen mode so

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.680
i'm just like i don't know uh eastern if eastern's here they might know they're the desktop national

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:12.720
treasure i'm going to tag them there we go um i i yeah let me just without a mod right

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.000
the mod didn't exist and i'm pretty sure pretty sure eastern was doing about mod all right

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.880
anyway moving forwards um that's that question's answered uh zacutole says are graphics lowering

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:32.440
mods safe i don't know i am reasonably certain that they are but i cannot say that they are

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.560
because mods are unsupported by the neos team if that makes sense i would suggest asking

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:43.240
the neos modding community what they think um but i can't answer that officially uh zafod

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.880
says one more thing how do i get the screen to pop up in obs uh i think froppy answered

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.260
that with the like tools web socket server settings uh i don't really know what you mean

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.600
by screen though um if you can clarify if you mean the game screen just use like a game

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.280
capture or window capture whichever works for you i alternate between game capture and

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.960
window capture because obs is fun as our window capture standards like for example if you

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.320
try and capture chrome and you're playing media on netflix like regardless what tab

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.080
is netflix will just like blank out or something or stop playing or spotify is like you're

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.800
recording i'm gonna pause it's just like guys what are we doing and then there's like hdcp

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.120
that's the thing that like makes protected content go through a hdmi driver and i'm just

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:29.120
like ah stop making standards okay let's get back on track to some sort of sense of normalcy

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:37.080
back to questions um magic says what would you say is the most under used um undervalued

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.720
feature that should be highlighted to new users um honestly not building like i know

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.800
we just talked about it uh with the sort of you know questions of being overwhelmed but

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.760
not building like it's very common for the mentality to be okay you set up your avatar

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.960
now you need to start building which then leads into the mentality of when i've started

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.000
building i'll make myself a custom multi-tool and a custom inspector and i'm just like no

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.560
go play games go experience stuff go play cabin of the seasons go look at the neos

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.040
fester it's running by the way there's a festival running made by the japanese community it's

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.360
amazing there are booths there are worlds go look at it uh you know you don't need to

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.620
build i guess would be the most underutilized feature of of of neos um and don't make a

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:25.120
custom multi-tool just use the standard tools please uh so safe what is now further clarified

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:32.480
what source does the in-game neos camera use in sources on obs it doesn't um okay so all

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.360
the obs um all the obs integration that we have inside neos does is integrates with obs

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.200
web socket to send a signal saying start recording stop recording or start streaming stop streaming

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.680
that's all it does um the camera itself when you enable the mirror display mode what it

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.600
will do is it will take the camera's view and it will mirror that to the the on-screen

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.360
um ui so if you have your headset on enable mirror to display peek under your headset

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.760
through the nose hole like you all do i know you'll do it peek through the nose hole and

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.160
look at your screen you'll see that it's displaying the camera view and not your view it separated

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:16.600
those two and then in obs you just capture using uh game capture or window capture the

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.800
window of neos and then it will display whatever the camera has recording inside obs and that's

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.980
how the magic works right um and it's only available like some people like why doesn't

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.280
mirror display work in desktop it's because it would be incredibly jarring to try and

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.880
make that work in desktop it might be possible if neos could like i don't know spawn two

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.740
display windows of neos and then one would be the mirrored and one wouldn't be the mirrored

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.700
and then you'd capture the mirrored one and play on the non-mirrored one but at that point

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.160
you're like running the game twice i mean you kind of already are doing with mirrored

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.880
to display but like the the glory about how it works is because you've got a headset on

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.200
your face that's got screens inside it well usually a screen sometimes two screens i never

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.800
remember which which headsets use two screens and which headsets use one screen that's just

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.740
sort of got a black bar in the middle that you can never see because it's behind the

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:08.920
lenses but whatever um that's that question done uh alexis are there any secret menus

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:13.840
or buttons that mods or devs have in neos there are many um none of which i can remember

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.800
right now i guess there's one like the world browser has some extra stuff if you're on

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:23.960
the team um which is you know subject to change but i can um remove a world from the world

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.480
browser or feature a world or add a tag if the world's having difficulties in searching

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.960
from the world browser um there's one other place but i can't even remember where it is

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:39.400
none of the like stuff that the team have access to in game is like scary or secret

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.160
or you know can't be told it's all like the stuff that we should have access to and permissiony

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:49.940
stuff um for example and i'm going to say this on record and i'm also going to say prove

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:58.440
me otherwise if you think so um the team including mods do not have access to private sessions

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.640
and the reason behind this is because when you start a private session we don't tell

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.720
the neos cloud where it is and you can verify this using wire shark or like a man-in-the-middle

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:13.800
proxy whatever you want like there is no information other than you are in a private session we

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:19.080
don't know where that private session is for us to join that private session we need to

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.000
first of all know where it is so like what ip address or setting it's on and then we

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.600
also need like an invite tokeny thing which again you can validate using wire shark right

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:33.060
i don't want to see in like two or three years people going like yeah but like mods and team

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.380
members can join your private sessions go validate it get wire shark get a man-in-the-middle

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.800
proxy prove it like we know that you're in a private session but that's the equivalent

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.900
of me saying to froppy hey i'm at home right now so froppy now knows i'm at home but they

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.500
don't know what i'm wearing or what i'm eating or what i'm looking at or what i'm doing but

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.280
they know that i'm in my house so we know that you're in a private session but we don't

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.140
know that anything's happening there or where it even is which is the same froppy doesn't

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.980
know where i live unless froppy does in which case froppy please don't don't like please

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:10.560
don't please don't attack me no anyway moving onwards back to some sense of normalcy again

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.040
i think they do stale take a 360 preview and um sorry spec said private sessions don't

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.140
take a 360 preview i think they still do and the reason behind that is uh depending on

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.560
which way you get the invite you'll be able to see that 360 view uh before you actually

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.620
join and then even in worlds that you're in which are private sessions they appear in

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.740
the world browser just for you and you'll be able to see uh 360 previews of that world

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:39.860
just for you because you have an invite in the world browser or more specifically anyone

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.220
that has an inviting capability of joining that session should should she should see

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:49.500
in the world browser but again yeah if you'd like to to challenge that the wire shark man-in-the-middle

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:55.700
proxy ask the modding community have a look uh moving forwards arriba says is it possible

00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:01.700
to edit uv maps inside neos no um mesh data is mostly static there are exceptions to that

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.940
for example you can remove blend shapes by baking your blend shapes do you do baking

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.460
your blend shapes will improve the performance of your avatar more than any other thing particularly

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.500
if you're a rex avatar um so please do bake your blend shapes but uh that edits mesh data

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.220
is what i mean um there's other stuff that you can do to edit mesh data such as like

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.220
fiddling normals recalculating tangents stuff like that by the way for three models there

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:25.780
what's the difference between normal and a tangent i have no idea anyway um you can't

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:31.040
edit uv maps moving forwards to screeners question someone friends list had the username

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.360
changed but i still see their old name on my contacts this other people see their new

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:40.940
name um that is probably a quirk for how the friend system works um please open a github

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.580
issue on that one it will be quite low priority but it's important that we have stuff like

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:49.260
that logged so we can take a look at it i know that the uh like the other one is like

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.040
sometimes the first message that you receive from someone will say it's coming from 1970

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:59.020
and people always joke that's just like a bug with like how you receive that first message

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.500
and how it tries to get the data to you as soon as possible that means that it doesn't

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.980
have a valid date so it displays the default date which happens to be the first date that

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:11.580
can exist in computing which happens to be in 1970 for those who are unaware your entire

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:16.140
computer right now every single computer including your phone and like if you've got an internet

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:22.340
of things thermostat it's also doing it it's counting the number of seconds since a specific

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:28.460
date in 1970 because we decided that's how time works i don't particularly know why it

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.340
was 1970 but that's how computers work when you synchronize your clock which is something

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.600
you need to do to make sure that neos connects correctly what you do is you ask another server

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:42.180
usually an ntp server but that basically means network time protocol but basically you ask

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:47.360
another server how many seconds has it been since 1970 and that computer says it's been

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.120
this many seconds and you go oh shit i had this my bad and then you adjust it that's

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:57.620
how time synchronization works it's it's silly also uh time synchronization breaks in 2038

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.620
but don't worry about it like there'll be a solution by 2038 january 1 1970 yeah i couldn't

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:08.380
remember if it's january 1st yeah it's january 1st 1970 it's called unix time um it is it

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:15.020
is fun i used to be a timekeeper uh lex says the windows epoch is different it is different

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:19.260
but still counting number of seconds since a specific date yes procedural meshes are

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:24.100
different as they just says uh down there that's uh another example uh nat says is the

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.540
position of the 360 preview of findable slots so i could say throw a box or something over

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:32.240
it no um if you don't have any of the thumbnail components uh there's a video tutorial on

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.160
my channel about how to use those um then what it does is it asks each user in the world

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:42.340
to take a 360 periodically and that usually comes from your head or near your head i can't

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:47.580
remember which and then each person in the session is taking that picture and then it

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:52.800
um the host of the session asks all the users in the session hey who has the most recent

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:58.220
headshot and then someone goes me pick me and then that's the session thumbnail unless

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:02.420
you use the the components in which case it's it's a slot that you can find i think that's

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:08.200
all the questions we have uh lucas has a uh answer to the normal versus tangent thing

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.600
so thank you so much for this because i i didn't i could of course google it but i'm

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.380
in office so thank you for for looking it up for me so the normal of the mesh is the

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.620
forward channel blue of the normal map the tangent of the mesh is the right channel red

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.180
of the normal map there's also by tangent which is the up green channel but this is

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.940
the last one that but this last one can be calculated by a cross product of the others

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.900
yep i understand that excellent thank you thank you lucas i believe that's all the questions

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.580
we have uh if you have any further questions or danger you are the last person who can

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.620
type a question log group has confused me a lot yeah me too i don't think it works correctly

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.100
i think we need to do some more work with it um other people have used it like it has

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:50.520
um like uh has moods i was trying to think of the word like it has nuances that's the

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:55.460
word i was thinking i ended up with like it has moods a lot of group is like i might work

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.740
i might not i need to like look up maybe document this existing behavior so we can understand

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.820
what needs to happen like if you were to go speak to fruits and be like oh what you need

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.600
to do the log group he'd like launch into like a very complicated explanation of plans

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.700
he has for that component but i want to get the current behavior sorted so that we understand

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:16.580
what it can do today with that i believe we're done so um i'm gonna go ahead and end here

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.500
if you have any further questions please go ahead and direct message me them or put them

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.060
in the questions and help section do remember that we're all here to help you look for a

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:29.620
