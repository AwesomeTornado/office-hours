WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
 It is 4pm, so we're going to get that started.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.200
 Let's jump straight into the questions that we have in the thread.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 So Lex says "What are the plans for Neocene again?"

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.280
 So Neocene was like, it's unfair to call that like a backup, but it's like an addition

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.080
 to the big chunky launcher, right?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.740
 We would be remaking the big chunky launcher and making that into like our own launcher.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.020
 So that would also allow us to have more of a backup in case the things like the steam

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.000
 removal happened again, whatever, we'd have our own launcher, etc.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.180
 But it would also allow us to sort of more simultaneously manage builds.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.000
 So if there was any testing needed, or people wanted to jump between the headless or the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.120
 quest build, or the android build, etc. they'd be able to do it a lot easier.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.720
 We'd also be able to serve builds there for different establishments, such as businesses,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.840
 education, learning, etc.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.180
 Yeah, that was what Neocene was meant to be.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.960
 Next up we have hentai games who says "What's the status of the lawsuit and when are we

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 getting an update?"

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 I don't know what that is.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.640
 I mean, my suit's in the cupboard, but like, I don't know what that is.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.520
 So I don't know.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.760
 And with that, we're out of questions.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.200
 So Jack asks "Is Neocene accompanied by a change in the build/deploy pipeline too?"

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.040
 Yeah, the idea there was to update how the build pipeline and the deployment pipeline

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 works.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:38.760
 It would have been a great actual hero scenario for the recent Cloudflare, YouTube download,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 MMC 2023 issues where we had builds being unsynchronized.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.520
 Right now, builds that are generated are like three different pipelines, and so it's really

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.680
 difficult sometimes to manage them.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.560
 Neocene would completely streamline that, and we'd be able to do that a lot easier.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.360
 Lou says "What tips practices would you recommend for inventory management?"

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.480
 I actually have a video on this one as far as I'm aware.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.420
 Let me go ahead and double check if I can find it.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.740
 It's been working really well outside of Neos as well, it does require diligence, and sometimes

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.680
 you'll end up clicking a lot of folders.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.520
 But if you start doing it, it really does prevent many issues.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.720
 People go "There is no inventory management in Neos, so I won't inventory manage."

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.240
 And I go "Okay, cool.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.760
 You could do a little bit of it."

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.320
 So yeah, but then all the stuff I hadn't managed would still be there.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.680
 I was like "Well, yeah, but you can do the new stuff."

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
 When did I upload that video?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.480
 I've not got a staff badge there, I've only got one row, and I'm wearing a center hat.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.440
 That's gonna be well dated, let me see.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.280
 Strangely the date isn't displayed in YouTube Studio, I have to go to the actual video.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280
 Two years ago!

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.840
 15 December 2020, fantastic.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.000
 I didn't answer the question, because it assumes things that don't exist, or might not exist.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.640
 It's a very strange question.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.400
 I guess the second half, yes, the second half, that's a better answer for the second half,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.200
 which is "Any updates will be in the announcements channel."

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.600
 And before you say there are no updates in the announcements channel, yes, any future

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.720
 updates will be in the announcements channel.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.300
 You can compare it to that one thing that you pre-ordered on the internet two years

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.880
 ago and it never shipped and then suddenly randomly arrived today.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.520
 I've got edi controllers sat next to me charging.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:36.320
 If you find checking the announcements channel problematic, you can always go to this amazing

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.760
 URL.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.200
 Jack has an overarching question.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.240
 What things are planned, considered for future improvements to new users' audio systems,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.640
 and better reverb zones, deafening zones, etc.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.360
 I would like to, firstly, in my opinion, I guess, and then for what we're actually doing,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.280
 you can go ahead and check the roadmap, but I would like to see, we were looking into

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.100
 it, I can't remember why we stopped, but we were looking into a different audio system

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.860
 that would allow the structure of the area that you're in to affect the audio in some

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.280
 way, like walls and doorways and stuff like that would have affected the audio.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.260
 I'd have to go double check what the name of that library that we were looking at is,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.900
 but that doesn't, I can't remember the name of it, etc.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.900
 We are using Steam audio right now for some things, I think we want to upgrade that.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:36.240
 I would like to see more tweaks to the logarithmic falloff, I would also like to see better tooling

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.700
 to visualize that as well.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.540
 It would be great if we had similar debug visuals to things like the reflection probe

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.300
 and the default cube editing for the falloff of audio, because I know most people just

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.400
 don't care, and they leave the falloff on logarithmic, they leave the sound at 100%,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.540
 and then everyone just complains because audio is always too loud, no one balances their

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.540
 audio.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.140
 Quick reminder there, balance your audio.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.740
 Here's how to balance your audio.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.180
 Set all of your audio bars to 100%, and then walk through your experience, your world,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.060
 your tool, etc., and figure out what needs to be quieter, what needs to be louder, what

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.720
 you shouldn't hear from across the map, what you should hear across from the map, and then

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.660
 you can normalize it there.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.300
 For anyone who doesn't agree with setting their audio levels to 100%, remember that

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.240
 the word 100% in the audio level means 100% of normal, or as in the intended way that

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.460
 the author wants this experience to be established with you.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.360
 So if you're running at like 2% audio, like I know most people are, then you're missing

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.760
 out on a lot of range that you can have there.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.320
 Let's say you're making a horror map, you know, maybe footstep sounds, sorry excuse

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.200
 me, are very quiet, but like the monster screaming and tearing you into pieces, that should be

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200
 a bit louder.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.780
 You get more range there if you use the entire audio bar, rather than just the bit that occurs

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.420
 between 2% and 0%.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.300
 Lexis, the ETE controllers don't work with Neos anymore?

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.300
 They do.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.380
 I think the path for using them is a bit different, but I've been collaborating with some of the

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.620
 people in the ETE Discord about that.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:17.660
 We have Silver, they are probably in this Discord, but Silver here is doing some logics

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.160
 with the ETE controllers.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.860
 It might be some facilities or gestures etc that don't work.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.860
 I don't know.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.680
 Mine arrived, and one was charged to full, and one wasn't charged to full, so I just

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.020
 put them all on charge.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.600
 I actually sent, I could find this library again, because I sent an email to the library

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.660
 creator, because it's not licensed.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.500
 Unfortunately like Gmail searching is just terrible.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.460
 Maybe it wasn't on that account.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.600
 I might have sent it from, it would make sense if I sent it from this account.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.600
 Yes, here it is.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.000
 Yeah, it's here.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.880
 There's literally no license, no information about it.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.000
 Acoustic echo cancelling, voice suppression, voice activity detection.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.300
 Very good module.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.800
 I asked for a license, they said no.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.440
 They said that it's open source, I don't want to give it a license, so I just said okay,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.440
 and we didn't use it.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.720
 I don't even remember why we did it.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.900
 Frix asked me to look into seeing if I could get them to clarify the license, so I was

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.900
 doing the email back and forth there.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.220
 Okay, jumping back up to questions, because I forgot them.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.800
 Glavin says are there plans to have a native built-in user calling system?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.380
 I would love for the halls like that to kind of be drop-in and easy to use.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.680
 We would of course make it so that you can disable them or build your own, because we

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.700
 don't want our tools to supersede or block the custom creation of additional tools.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.960
 But I would love for more logical systems to exist.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:56.680
 I know that VRChat has done some amazing stuff with culling, both audio and avatar related,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.640
 which we should absolutely emulate, and then someone starts saying, "No, you're going to

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.200
 steal it or copy it from VR."

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.600
 It's like, come on, guys.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.560
 I am complimenting VRChat on a pre-feature, well-created, and saying that we could emulate

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.520
 similar features on our platform, that's totally fine.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.680
 Jack comments that there's stuff that Logics can't do, like reduce update rates and stuff

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.680
 like that.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.400
 Yes, if we made a system, it would have a lot more capabilities than Logics.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.620
 However, we could take a look at providing additional components, nodes, etc., that would

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.040
 allow that additional functionality to be established.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.600
 Something like that, when we're giving you more control over the world, might have to

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.120
 wait for hard permissions, though, because at that point we are enabling you to kind

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.120
 of damage the world.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.820
 A bit like the knockback gun problem, we gave people the functionality to accelerate people

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.440
 at the speed of light, and that's cool, because you can make guns and stuff that knock people

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.880
 back, but if you crank those numbers up all the way, then weird stuff happens.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.940
 So if you did that, the same with IK or culling and stuff like that, there might be some worse

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.560
 consequences for that that we'd have to sort of handle.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.900
 Jack mentions the IK culling mod, yeah, I've looked into that one.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:14.080
 Every mod I look into the source code of, I'm like, I'm sorry, guys, I'm so sorry, because

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:20.260
 it's like one line of code to change something that annoyed people.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.320
 Jack asks, did you ever find your personalized easter egg in our MMC entry?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.880
 You'll have to unfortunately remind me of which gear and which entry.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.960
 I looked at far too many, and oftentimes it was not clear who worked on the list, or if

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.360
 it was, it was just a big list that sort of merged into one.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.200
 No, in which case I did not notice it on dashcam.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.960
 There was actually, that was like, I know it's like, you know, months away from MMC

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.920
 2024, but that is something to note as well.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.620
 I don't want to pick on, you know, anyone individual, but I've got to to provide my

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.060
 example and talking point.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.800
 So Rukio, good map, fantastic work team.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.320
 However, they put a lot of secrets and easter eggs into their map, and they were quite hidden,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.960
 like more hidden than I think was reasonable, and therefore we didn't notice that they

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.320
 existed and found them confusing.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.360
 There were a couple of bugs that prevented us from looking at those, but it was like,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.580
 cool, there are easter eggs in here, but they weren't easy enough to find.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.440
 Now I know mainstream games sometimes do that, like there's a side quest in Final Fantasy

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.560
 IX that took ten years to find.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.240
 That's okay, because it's like a mainstream game, but when it comes to just a world or

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:37.000
 a session as a part of MMC, if you want those easter eggs to be part of your judging, please

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.320
 make them more obvious.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.000
 We have so many entries to look at, and not enough time to look at all of them.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.240
 So at a certain point, what I had to do in Rukio's entry was go, I know that there is

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.800
 more here, like I can see that something is meant to happen here, but I just unfortunately

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.360
 don't have time to discover it.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.360
 There's something about like, if you made a certain drink, then something would appear,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.100
 and if that thing appeared, you can then collect them, and then if you collected them, a new

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.100
 duck appeared.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.560
 And the only reason I knew that, oh not duck, floaty appeared.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.480
 And the only reason I knew that is because I saw something weird, and then I inspected

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.640
 it, and I was like "oh I see this", because I was then technically analysing the system.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.080
 Oh, Jackal, thought, do you...

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.120
 So Jackal asks "how's the move, are other efforts going, do you think you'll be starting

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.320
 out tutorials again at some point?"

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.360
 I'm still incredibly busy with a variety of things that are non-neos related before

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.640
 anyone starts like Moveroo the rumour mill.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.160
 I'm trying to get the move sorted, I have now applied for the apartment building, which

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.560
 is next to my apartment building.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.960
 They needed income verification, which I provided, and for some reason that's gone all the way

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.000
 up to the regional manager of the company that owns the building, and she is not responding

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.040
 to her email, so that's fun.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.280
 She needs to respond in the next couple of days or she'll lose a customer.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.100
 She'll lose a customer with a very good credit score as well, so you know, she's losing out.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.440
 Once that's sorted, then I can do things like arrange movers.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.380
 I haven't got that much to move, but I am feeble and weak, I can't move a bed and a

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.120
 bookshelf by myself.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.000
 And then I'll probably get a cleaner to do it once over here, because they charge you

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.440
 anyway, but if you get a cleaner to do it, then they don't have to do it.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.640
 And they won't charge you, but you'll charge - it works out cheaper.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.680
 "But you have requested a tutorial about the multi-UV material and what it's good for."

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.000
 I can give you an example straight off the top of my head.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.400
 It really comes up a lot in avatar management and stuff like that.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.780
 So let's imagine you have an avatar that has a scrolling emissive effect.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.500
 I mean sometimes it's stars or sparkles or stuff like that.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:44.340
 In some cases, you want elements to scroll differently over the UV than other elements.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:49.180
 Like for example, you might want the star or the sparkle shape that's on your emissive

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.100
 map to scroll at a higher rate than something else.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.400
 And the only real way to do that is to scroll those at different rates, which means different

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.680
 properties, which usually means different UVs.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.620
 If you think about the UV for a face, that's sort of where you take the skin off someone's

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.420
 avatar and lay it down flat like some sort of weird mass murderer.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:14.300
 That is one set of UVs, but then maybe another set of UVs is the stars or the twinkles that

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.680
 you need to scroll across their face.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.880
 And that's why you'd use more UVs.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880
 Separate those up.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.520
 Yeah, good idea to use that.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.160
 I have to look at my avatar and take a look at that.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.840
 Inside of Blender, you can use as many UV maps as you want.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.520
 And I know that a lot of people use those for things like baking and shadows and stuff

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.720
 like that.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:39.800
 Lots of prep that I see for Substance Painter uses multi UV maps.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.540
 There's stuff in Blender that I still don't know what it's for.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.780
 And I'm just like, this looks cool, but I don't know what it's for.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.500
 And the whole reason behind that is I don't do renders in Blender.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.380
 I don't do any of the sort of animation in Blender.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.820
 I don't even do particle systems or geometry.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.380
 No, I haven't looked into that yet.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:02.380
 I just like I have a character ID to like, you know, reweight paint their arm or something.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.460
 Just I use it for like probably like a small part of its capabilities.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.500
 Jack is commenting on the fact that they are starting up work on a new version of their

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.020
 MMC project, which is fantastic.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.420
 They do comment that they were burnt out by MMC.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.260
 The goal of MMC isn't to isn't to burn you out.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.100
 So make sure that you are approaching it with your health in mind.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.900
 Lex says one thing for them is that they're not going to work on multiple entries.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.900
 That's a very good idea.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.060
 For those who remember the NCC, which is the Neos contest, I made three entries.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.220
 And the reason was because back then Neos was so small, I wanted there to be a wealth

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.460
 of entries.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.460
 And I had a lot more time there because I wasn't on the team.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.220
 So I made three entries.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.540
 I wouldn't suggest doing that.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.540
 There are no additional questions.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.340
 I will scroll up the list, double check and I haven't missed any.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.620
 I haven't missed any that I can see.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.980
 How many additional questions do you let me know?

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.980
 I put them in that thread and I'll get them in the order that they have here.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.780
 Lex asks would you know why accepting a contact request takes an indeterminate amount of time

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.120
 extra time for the person who's getting accepted?

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.820
 It's something to do with polling and caching as far as I'm aware.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.740
 I know that's like a sort of like, what's the word I'm looking for?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.220
 Lacklustre I guess we'll do for now.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.460
 I know it's a lacklustre answer, but it's always that particular thing.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.520
 I know that we want to expand our SignalR offerings such that that's faster and more

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.540
 immediate in the future.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.420
 But you know, it is 4.24pm.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.780
 We'll keep going for a little bit longer.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.780
 But if you don't have any...

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.700
 Oh my god, that's a big question.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.660
 So go ahead and get that done.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.660
 Okay, cool.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:40.420
 I've got some reading to do.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.700
 So Jackal has a gigantic question which we're going to read.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.620
 Vakrin, I have set up a simple round frame.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.620
 I have to read it because otherwise it doesn't appear on the recording.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.780
 I have set up a simple round frame that I'd like to be linked to my context menu.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.580
 I've set up with the virtual parent component, an additional value copy board component so

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.740
 that I can drive its active state using the active state of the visual chart of the context

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.220
 menu slot attached to me and the player.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.820
 Likewise, the override parent field is set to said visual slot.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.180
 Let's set my frame's rotation scale and position using targets, virtual parent, and local settings

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.180
 to make it pretty.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.540
 This works great, but only if every time I spawn I drag the visual slot into the override

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.420
 parent field of the virtual parent and the active i field name of the visual slot into

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.020
 the source of the value copy manually.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.460
 I try to replicate these actions and logics if any miserably.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.380
 The object has dark grey invalid markers all over when I respawn, and lately when I try

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.020
 to drive the active field, my object nears crashes entirely with an n-e-a-splosion in

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.020
 its locks.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.220
 I'm having a difficult time getting consistent series of events though, so thank you for

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.220
 reading my book.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.220
 I'll get to the question.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.580
 How can I recreate those actions that I have to do manually using logics or components

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.700
 or some combination thereof so the frame object automatically sets itself up?

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.860
 If it's a timing issue where I have to put in some kind of delay, don't the rest of me

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.380
 load or any sub-hardwired or something zero?

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.380
 Okay, right.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.500
 So in summary, they're trying to get a frame or a ring to appear in the same place as their

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.460
 context menu when they open it.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.380
 Lots of people do that for visual aesthetics etc.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.020
 Better not have a loud sound effect associated with it.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.820
 It's just a visual, we're good.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:18.340
 And they need to orchestrate a virtual parent component and a value copy component to copy

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.100
 those values around to make that work.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.980
 You can absolutely do that.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.580
 Good, good, no sound, no flashy lies to say.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.660
 You can absolutely do that with logics.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.380
 I would probably say, okay, Jack said that they suggested a solution to the problem,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.500
 if you need help you can contact me in game, great, so that's the solution.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.020
 You can absolutely do that with logic.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.940
 You'll probably have to use things like the slot finding nodes or the slot descending

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.440
 nodes, you know, like get child, get child, etc. to descend down to find the slot that

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.940
 you're after.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:54.600
 Once you have a slot reference, you can get that active property from that slot with get

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.940
 slot is active, etc. inside logics.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.980
 You can also write slot references to virtual parent, etc.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.620
 That should all work fine.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.740
 You may need a delay though.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:12.380
 Here's the sort of rule of thumb that usually works is stick an update delay of two in there.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.660
 I don't know why two works well, I just always use two.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.660
 Sometimes two doesn't work.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:22.260
 I know if you could say something about dynamic variables and that requires six, but yeah,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.820
 stick an update delay of two and it should work.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:31.300
 It should totally be available to do using a variety of logics.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.820
 Update delay is a node.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.820
 Update delay is a node.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:39.300
 Update order you shouldn't really need to touch.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:44.740
 There's lots of things where I add the two, update delay two, that I don't really know

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.780
 why I just have to.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.900
 As with the updating relay and similar things like that, try adding those things and then

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.860
 if it does work, great.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.660
 But if it doesn't work, do you remember to re-remove those because then you're not consistently

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.780
 adding bloat that you don't know why it's there.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.780
 I do that every time.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.300
 Like I get some like logic just won't work.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.380
 I start adding random update delays, it works.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.100
 I start removing update delays until it doesn't work again and I know exactly where the problem

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.100
 is occurring.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.940
 It's basically like an order of operations thing.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:15.420
 Like if logics is faster than some non-logics process or vice versa, then stuff won't line

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.420
 up sometimes.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.100
 Particularly in avatar spawning, which sounds like the problem that you're describing.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.260
 Jack says, "Would you be interested in perhaps throwing together an official NES calendar

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.020
 once I have the thing improved?"

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.020
 You mean an in-game calendar?

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.020
 Yeah, sure.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.540
 And we want to get the event system set up on this Discord here.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.540
 I don't remember the exact reason why we don't have it here.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.820
 We want to get that sorted.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.260
 I also want to get a calendar sorted that is on our website ideally.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.940
 I would love if we could have like more social style stuff on our website.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.980
 I always talk about it, but it kind of doesn't make sense anymore.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.500
 Like the AltSpaceVR event calendar was amazing.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.540
 It was basically, you know, you want to host an event where it's just you playing a guitar

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.540
 in a fire, like a round of fire based map.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.540
 You know what I mean?

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.860
 Campfire, that's the word I was looking for.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.960
 Round of campfire on a map like that, you can just post that to the AltSpaceVR webpage

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.200
 and people can come.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.620
 You want to do a special interest group?

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:15.620
 We saw everything on that list from religion to politics to support groups, etc.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.620
 It was great.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.060
 Unfortunately, Microsoft has pulled the plug on AltSpaceVR.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.100
 I don't know how far along they are in pulling the plugs, it might exist, but I'd love to

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.360
 get that on the website at some point.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.360
 And in game.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.740
 We have like a community tab on the dash, that would be amazing.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.580
 But starting in five minutes, Jack plays the trombone.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.260
 I don't know if he can play the trombone, I just thought the first instrument that popped

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.500
 into my head.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.500
 Next question.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:47.420
 Second, says "Do you know of any changes that may have happened to make LNL more unreliable,

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.420
 more desynchial of later?

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.540
 Is it like an external factor like international peering that's just going downhill?"

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.220
 There have been no changes to those things as of late.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.060
 Cloudflare would have not affected those, because that's a socket channel which would

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.060
 not go via Cloudflare.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.140
 No changes I can think of.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.840
 International peering might be a culprit.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.360
 I am so happy that someone so far away knows what international peering is, thank you so

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.180
 much for knowing that phrasing.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.660
 So many people don't understand how crazy the internet is, so I'm glad you know that

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.660
 term.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.100
 Raid, I can never pronounce your name, I'm sorry, I've seen your pronunciation guide,

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.180
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.860
 Do slots load in a consistent order at all is the way to manipulate order slots load

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.860
 in.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.480
 Not that I'm aware of, although try the update order.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.900
 That does affect things like aligners, UIX, and things like that, so it might affect load,

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.900
 I'm not certain.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.620
 Yeah, the internet is just crazy.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.660
 Stop using super reactions, guys, don't those cost like, you can only do like five of those

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.220
 a month or something.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.980
 Five a day, oh that's fine, yeah, five a day, I thought it was five a month, I've never

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.580
 used them because I thought it was five a month.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.980
 It's like when you play a video game and like, you know, some quest giver will be like "thank

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.700
 you for savoring the forest, here's this like potion that will make you super awesome",

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.300
 but you never drink it, because you're never like "oh I might need it for like, I might

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.860
 need it for like", you get to the credits and you're just like "never drank that super

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.620
 awesome potion, never drank that super awesome potion".

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:17.860
 Per week, it's per week, that's still bad, okay, thank you, I go.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.020
