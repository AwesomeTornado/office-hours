WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
All right, now it's four.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.680
Welcome to Office Hours.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.120
This is the half-hour segment where I answer

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.700
questions from chat and

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.560
everyone else that questions up here.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.840
We have one question waiting,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.080
so I'll go ahead and just jump straight into that.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.040
We are recording, yep, so you'll hear on the recording.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.200
I can ask, is there a way to merge changes between two worlds?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200
For example, I have version one and I publish it,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.080
but I want to work on version 1.1 over a few weeks,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.920
so I save a copy of that world to work on.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.240
Once done, is it possible to merge

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.400
those changes back to the published world?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.360
Yes and no. There's no way to merge it at the world level,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.560
so there's no UI for that,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.200
there's no feature for that that can happen.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.460
But if you do a good practice,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.040
which is where everything in a world is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.440
parented to a slot other than root,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560
then you can go ahead and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.240
just transfer that slot between the worlds,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.200
and that will allow you to merge those changes in.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.560
Version management on worlds is something that we need to do

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.520
a lot more work on as a team at

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.280
NEEUS to make it a lot easier to figure out.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.960
I am plagued by

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
people doing that in a way that doesn't really make sense to me.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.000
So when I make a world, I have one world,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.480
and if I publish it and I break it, I'll just fix it.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.080
So I don't maintain multiple versions of worlds.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.120
Additionally, I practice something which I really

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.760
wish many, many, many more people would practice,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.320
which is you don't need to save

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.760
the world if you're just saving bits of it.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.520
So example here being,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.520
you're in a tavern world and you've edited the drink system.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.440
Just save the drink system and then replace that in the world.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.080
You don't need to save another copy of the world,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.120
and then that makes it easier.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.920
You just go into the published world once you're

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.320
aware that your new drink system

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.600
works and you replace the drinks.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.680
Stop treating the world

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.520
as a big circle and save parts of it.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.440
I always have little bits of the world which I can then load in,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.640
position, update, and it makes it a lot

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.560
easier because you can just save stuff to the inventory.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.400
I've got one world on the go right now for

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.480
some science where we're doing eye testing.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.600
So we're testing your vision and stuff like that.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Really, really cool. Many players have eye-tracked headsets,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.760
but I do let me know.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.080
I'm keeping a list for future times.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.320
Anyway, the point being is

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.960
that there are components of that world.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.840
There is the system which records

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.440
the data from your eye-tracked headset.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.120
There is the way to do those eye movements.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.040
So it's basically like it makes a dot move and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.360
you've got to follow them in case it's a separate system.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.440
There's a system which can block one eye or

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.320
the other eye such that we're only testing the left or right eye.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.640
That's, again, separate. All those parts are separate.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.360
If I update them, I just replace them in

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.240
the world and they work because they're all separate.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.840
Shifty has updated me saying that

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.360
the world overwrite function is not working.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.600
I forgot that that button existed,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.880
but probably because it's broken,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.080
it left my brain.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.240
So do take a look at that particular issue which may

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.680
help with overwriting worlds and versions and stuff like that.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.280
It is 3044 for the reference.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.880
Yeah, it's a thing.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.120
There's an enter button.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.000
It's like a square with an arrow in it and it can overwrite worlds.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.880
I forgot it existed because I've never used it because it was broken.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.080
It's weird. If you own a house,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.800
I guarantee, well, also if you rent,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.600
but basically, and maybe even if you just have a room in the house.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.920
Anyway, the point being,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.000
there is something that you need to do that you haven't

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.400
done for so long you've just forgotten that it exists.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.280
If you own a house, it's usually something like cleaning the gutters.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.640
But that's an example of that problem that you can relate to.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.040
Just forgetting about something because it's been broken for so long.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.040
No, it's not that button.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.160
Maybe it is that button. I'll just stop talking about that feature because evidently,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.280
I don't know how it works,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.600
but I thought that's the one that did it.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.360
Anyway, there is a way to do it.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.160
Check that GitHub issue for information.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.000
That's issue 3044.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.880
Moving onwards to additional questions.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.920
Duff asks, what is Prime's preference of drink while playing Neo?

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.960
So what advice would you like to share to those who are drinking age while drinking in VR?

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.320
If you have a face tracker, get a straw.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.560
I have taken to drinking tea with a straw,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.840
which is very strange, but there we go.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.240
When I first got the face tracker and

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.880
strapped it to the front of my headset via various means,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.160
I was constantly just punching it in the face,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.640
and that was just problematic.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.840
I've learned now I need to reach around it,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.280
and a straw does help with that.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.880
Generically, a straw does help when you are drinking anything in VR.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.680
I don't tend to drink alcohol these days.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.040
It's not out of any preference or need or medical stuff like that.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.240
It's just it's expensive and I am unable to get drunk.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.400
I can bathe in alcohol and still be not drunk.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.240
So there's no point.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.760
Does it taste better in some cases?

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.160
Yes. In the majority cases, no.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.800
So there's no real point.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.440
I managed to quit soda as well.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.360
Soda is incredibly addictive and if you are a regular soda drinker,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.680
you're probably just addicted to it.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.680
I was on regular soda, of course,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.000
growing up because that's kids and we don't really care about our health.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.360
But then when growing up, I'm like,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.480
hey, that's unhealthy, I should switch to diet.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.200
So I was on diet soda for many years,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.560
and then I realized how addictive it was when I stopped drinking it for a while,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.160
just randomly, and then went back to it and it was gross.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.440
I hadn't drunk soda in forever and I drank it again.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.960
I'm like, this is gross.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.120
I was just addicted to the random components of the soda.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.080
So yeah, it's usually just water and tea these days.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.680
Although I do, I have joined the cold coffee.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.320
Everyone's like, it's cold brew.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.800
I'm like, no, I just stir cold water into instant coffee,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.400
and that's cold brew as far as I'm concerned as well.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.720
That is purely for caffeine.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.160
I will like stir cold water into coffee, instant coffee, and then just chug it.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.240
And that's how I start my day these days.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.240
I will not join the Starbucks frappe whip caramel banana sprinkles,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.480
pumpy squirty sauce crew.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.800
That's just crazy.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.640
There's a meme image I can never find where it's like a two panel comic

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.680
and it's someone holding like a really big fancy frappe style drink.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.560
And the speech bubble says, I'm just not me without my coffee in the morning.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.000
And then the next panel of this comic is like a breakdown of what's in the drink.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.040
And it's like less than 1% coffee.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.200
The rest of it is just like pure sugar.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.680
And so the meaning being, they're looking for the sugar.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.360
They're not looking for the caffeine, but I can't find that comic.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.560
So if anyone wants to sort of Google through that, fantastic.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.640
Thank you.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.800
We don't have any other questions.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.760
Hence why I'm talking about coffee and things like that.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.120
So actually I can comment on Epic Eastern who says,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.440
Prime, you are the funny source code man.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.160
You're supposed to know everything.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.320
I don't know anything, everything.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.880
There are like thousands of files and like,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.720
I'm not sure like Fruits knows all of them.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.080
Of course he can like remember them.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.520
It's like, you know, when you hear like a familiar tune and you're like,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.040
Oh yeah, I have listened to that before,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.160
but I don't remember how the tune went.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.840
That's because it's not being used.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.320
The memory is kind of like fainter.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.480
So I'm quite certain there are parts of Neos,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.880
which are like at the back of Fruits's head.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.000
And he won't remember as well.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.680
So it's normal to not know.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.360
Like I found out the other day, you know, the Neos launcher,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.720
like the old one, not the new one, like the old, old one,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.880
the one that actually, you know, do various stuff.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.320
I'll just get a picture of it for reference.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.200
No, that took a picture of just the Neos logo

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.640
at the top of it.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.080
The purple logo on that is a good distinction.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.480
So you have like four of them right now.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.520
Yeah, the purple logo one.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.280
The purple logo one.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.160
Lots of people are using, you see what it says?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.840
Use custom bootstrap class right at the bottom there.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.760
Use custom bootstrap class isn't meant for what

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.080
people are using it for.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.240
Like what people are doing is they're checking that

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.440
and then they put in command line arguments.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.320
And this works, but it's a bug that it works.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.400
It's not meant to work.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.920
It's like, it's a bug.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.920
So the custom bootstrap text box is actually meant

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.880
to provide a custom bootstrap class,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.960
which no one to my knowledge has done.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.600
I think Neos classroom does it.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.440
And like one other business thing we did back in the day

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.440
did it, but that's actually a way for you to,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.280
in addition to plugins,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.280
it's a way for you to customize how Neos launches.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.120
So if you do that,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.600
and there's no documentation on how to do it.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600
So if you're interested, let me know.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.560
I'll write some documentation,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.000
but like no one has used this feature

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.200
as far as I'm aware.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.960
It will allow you to change the startup routine.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.760
So the startup routine will be like,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.080
yo, I'm going to do this stuff.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.440
So it checks and logs you in.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.040
It fetches your avatar, does a bunch of stuff like that.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.160
With that custom bootstrap class option,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.520
you can basically say, no, don't do that.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.400
Instead, open this very specific world,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.400
load this specific avatar into this world

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.040
and do not connect on the Neos cloud.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.680
That's what you could do with that bootstrap class.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.840
It is a bug.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.200
It's a bug.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.840
Great.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.040
I know you guys are using it.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.800
It will continue to work because by the time we fix it,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.640
we'll have something as an alternate there that will work

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.680
or maybe we'll just place another checkbox with it

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.480
or whatever, but it is quite literally a bug.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.720
So yeah, that was just some random anecdote.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.400
Ruscio, it's fine that you put the questions in here.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.360
I know it's different for this week.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.280
Ruscio dropped a question in the regular chat.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.640
We're putting questions in threads,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.560
just trying to keep things organized.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.320
I will accept the question outside of the thread,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.320
but just keep the next subsequent questions

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.120
in the thread. Thank you.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.440
Let's move forward on questions

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.880
rather than talking about coffee,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.640
although Dier recommends French press for cold brew.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.200
I used to have a French press machine.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.360
It worked on 240 volts, so I couldn't bring it here.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.600
Scary guy for asking a question.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.280
It goes in the thread.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.680
Thank you for the memes here. Cool.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.480
Okay, let me just double-check that we're not missing

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.920
in questions before I go to the ones that are at the bottom.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.120
Okay, so we'll go for Duff's first.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.240
Duff came before Ruscio, so Duff, Ruscio,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.240
and then whoever types the question next. Excellent.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.960
So Duff says, what would you say at what point

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.240
would NeosModerator take initiative disciplinary action

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.560
without the use pre-resc of a moderation ticket to be inputted?

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.320
I will defer to the response which Git gave

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.840
at the previous moderation office hours,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.360
which I'm going to quote from memory,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.760
so please do check the notes for the official commentary

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.160
from the moderation team,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.120
but that the moderation team can issue temporary restrictions

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.480
which are designed to just de-escalate the situation.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.760
So that might be just like a temporary public ban

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.440
so people can't join public sessions,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.200
which they then are required to follow up with a ticket

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.920
such that there is a record of it

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.960
where a discussion and proper ticket process

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.920
will happen about maybe extending that to a longer period.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.360
So a good example there might be hate talking

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.320
about moderation things because of stuff like this,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.800
but I'll just think of an example.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.040
So let's say harassment, right? Let's say sexual harassment.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.840
So that happens. I would, as a moderator,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.400
I would issue a temporary ban,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.520
and then I would open up a ticket

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.840
where we could discuss what happened next.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.480
It's important to remember that moderators are not beat cops.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.000
They're not designed to go around and police sessions.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.440
They're also not designed to get in their squad cars

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.120
and, you know, blip up and down the road

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.080
that's next to my house at like 4 a.m.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.040
with their, like, sirens on,

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.400
but not the sirens that are regular.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.200
You know the, like, intense sirens they do sometimes,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.280
the more high-pitched ones?

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.800
Usually when someone's in their way,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.240
they're just, like, going up and down the road

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.480
outside my apartment all the night doing that.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.760
I don't know why.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.880
Anyway, moderators are not designed to do that.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.240
Yeah, we're going to try it.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.960
I think it'll be better for, like,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.160
scrolling through the office hours.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.200
I'm sorry. We're talking about the threads for questions

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.920
because, to me, even when I scroll back,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.720
it's kind of difficult to see when one starts and one ends.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.760
There's usually a lot of messages which are around the area,

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.280
you know, from the people hosting office hours,

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.440
but sometimes they're harder to miss,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.360
so maybe threads will be better.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.840
I don't know. We're just trying it.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.680
It's a request. I think it's a good idea, so we'll try it.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.480
Moving on to Risio's question, which is next,

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.800
which is, in the Creator Jam 4 last,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.400
we're looking for a way to produce custom curves

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.200
and start checking out the Bezier curve component points

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.200
in the curve tip.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.360
They seem to work by themselves,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.600
but there's also felt incomplete

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.320
as there's no way to clear the gizmos

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.600
beside manually detailing, manually, manually deleting them.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.960
Are there any further enhancements planned

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.920
for these components that you know of?

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.760
No.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.240
The curve tip is actually a really old one.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.720
You can tell that just by inspecting it.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.960
You can also tell it by reading the code.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.800
Like, it's ancient.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.080
So there isn't anything planned to address that yet.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.200
I think we had...

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.840
Like, when I mentioned the curve tip previously to Frix,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.880
he said that that's old and it might be removed

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.840
but replaced with functionality to do that

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.360
in such a way where you could remake it

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.160
as a Neos builder rather than a Neos developer.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.760
There are a bunch of sort of curvy chubby meshes

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.680
that we have, and at some point,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.120
I want to sort of reconcile them

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:42.760
and put them together such that there are less.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.240
The same with straight line meshes as well.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.840
There's segment mesh, slot segment mesh, line mesh.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.680
There's just so many, and they're basically

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.680
just like, draw a line.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.160
Even the curve ones are, draw a line.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.200
So it's like, maybe we could standardize them

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.600
into something that made it a little bit easier to know,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.520
especially that slot segment mesh versus segment mesh.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.680
I can never remember which one's best.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.000
One has more options than the other,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.360
and you should use the one that has more options,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.760
because you're like, I don't know, maybe.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.280
As far as like editing and stuff to do with curves,

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.680
check out the Vigileboes folder.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.840
They don't really play Neos that much right now,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.320
but all of the like types of curves that you would need

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.320
have editors inside that folder.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.880
You're looking for blue thick lines

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.040
with like green dots on them

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.440
when you're looking for the thumbnail

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.400
in the public folder.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.360
I get those out every time I want to use a chubby mesh,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.000
so I can just remind myself of which chubby meshes do which.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.200
If you'd like better functionality in the area as well,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.600
make sure that there is a GitHub open for it.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.240
Scary, yes, I could totally lock down Office Hours.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.800
I'm just not currently doing it.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.440
Yeah, the curve tip is really interesting.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.880
It will make a complete mess of your world though,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.360
because each of those points,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.800
the like ones attached to the line

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.160
that leads to the main point,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.400
those are called control points, by the way,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.880
is on my route, and it's just like there.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.680
If you delete the curve, you can't,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.680
basically you'll spend like five minutes

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.560
cleaning up that curve that you made, Easton.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.560
It's not fun.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.840
Same thing with the label tip, actually.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.720
I've never really understood why the label tip

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.720
doesn't create something more sensible.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.920
The label tip will make two slots in your world route

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.480
called label point and label content.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.400
I wish it would like be a bit more intelligent about that

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.920
and make one slot called label and parent the point

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.960
and the content to that,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.000
and I might actually update the label tip

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.200
to do that when I can.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.200
There are a lot of tools that need to either be removed

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.320
or updated such that they work.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.880
You can tell a lot of this, by the way,

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.640
by going to start new world or create new world

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.680
and choosing the scratch-based template.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.520
The scratch-based template is a holdover

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.360
from the days where there was no inventory system in Neos.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.040
When there was no inventory system in Neos,

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.680
if you didn't have the developer tool,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.880
you had to go to the scratch-based world to get it.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.600
And if you wanted to save something,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.600
you had to go to your cloud or local home

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.400
and drop it there to save it.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.760
That didn't used to be a cloud home, by the way.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.840
So you had to save it to your local home as well.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.160
And so I remember, I hear things

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.240
from people that are around at that time

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.680
where they were just like, yep,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.120
we would just grab everything and return it to our homes

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.000
and save it there because we didn't know if we needed it

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.600
and it was very difficult to get.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.400
So do be thankful that we have inventory systems now.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.600
Moving forward to the next question.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.840
Lex says, would you know if there's any reason

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.400
when saving objects that they are locally compressed as LZ4

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.560
but when uploaded, they are compressed with 7-zip?

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.720
There are multiple compression algorithms that we have

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.000
and have support for.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.880
Neos will pick one in a way that I don't understand

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880
when you upload stuff.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.760
I don't particularly understand why, how, or what.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.760
I also thought 7-zip's compression was similar to LZ4.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.960
We would like a few modifications.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.040
I don't really remember, though.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.800
Peach, yes, you can answer any questions that you want,

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.280
whatever you would like.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.120
Rusio has found a curve tip custom

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.640
that makes things a little bit cleaner.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.040
There is a Neos2p link for that.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.080
Try that one out.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.680
Yeah, I want, Ramp has talking about the LZ4

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.160
and things.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.920
I'm not gonna comment on further stuff to do

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.760
with compression.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.240
I'll have to open up the code and do that.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.600
If there are no questions, I can sort of idly poke at it,

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.760
but I wouldn't actually know where to go.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.520
For those who are familiar with programming,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.200
and for those who are not, I'll try and explain it.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.480
There's like layers to code,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.560
and asset uploading is like the deepest part of the code.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.320
It would be the equivalent of me like opening that drawer,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.080
that one drawer that you haven't sorted out in a while,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.320
and like emptying the entire thing onto my bed,

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.120
and then like going through it to try to figure out

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.880
where the hell that piece of code is.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.320
It's like a descent into madness.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.160
It's really great when you come out of one of those, though,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.880
because you'll remember how to get there.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.040
Visual Studio has this cool feature called Bookmarks,

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.320
which I heavily use

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.320
because it just makes navigating things faster,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.200
particularly when I get questions about common stuff.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.840
So I have a bookmark that takes me straight

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.760
to the entry point for all of the Neospot commands,

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.320
so I can get there quickly.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.240
I've got another entry point,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.160
which takes me to rig classification stuff,

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.480
so I can find really quickly any sort of rig-based issues,

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.440
sort of like that.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.400
Now, that isn't to say that the code base is bad.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.520
That's just something that happens

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.760
with a code base this big,

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.080
is like sometimes you're like, yeah, that's really deep.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.640
I've got to like spend a lot of time

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.040
finding like the end of that.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.880
Like, for example,

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.640
I was looking at opening worlds the other day,

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.520
and there are about like 15 different ways

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.600
for the code base to open a world,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.120
and they all do like various things differently.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.760
And so it was just like, okay, cool.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.520
I don't know which one I need to use.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.000
Let's take a look down at additional questions.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.320
Alex says, what's something you didn't expect

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.400
the Neos community to make, but have?

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.440
Honestly, I'm still dumbfounded every time I see

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.040
that someone has made another multi-tool

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.640
and another custom inspector.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.400
If you are considering making another custom tool,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.160
a multi-tool or a custom inspector,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.720
please, please make something else.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.760
Make a Neos world where you are a cat

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.760
trying to save the world from extremist broccoli

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.360
who are trying to take over the world using chlorophyll.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.480
There you go.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.240
Just like make a game, make an experience.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.400
That was a completely random idea.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.320
Make things, make things.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.560
There is one thing, Lex did say positive things.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.320
The positive things, I guess, are all the micro tools.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.360
You know, there's a process that we want to do,

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.920
and then there's a tool made that makes it easier.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.920
I did expect some of them,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.080
but like it's getting kind of crazy how much those are.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.880
If you mean, you know, additionally positive there,

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.880
like the, I always go back to abandonware.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.920
Like abandonware, like if abandonware, the AMC entry,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.920
if that was on Steam for under 10 bucks,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.880
it would be really, really popular.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.360
Like it was not going to make like thousands of dollars

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.200
or anything like that,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.000
but like it would be very popular on Steam.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.040
And if it was on Steam, people like the market players

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.280
and the other horror game players of the world

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.080
will have played it and put it on their channel as well.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.200
Like that's how good that one felt.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.160
Next question here.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.000
Scary Guy says, what's the airspeed velocity

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.880
of an unladen swallow?

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.520
Do you mean an African or European swallow?

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.160
I think that's the quote, anyway.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.240
Zach says, is there a way to clear a string

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.080
when a video ends?

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.920
Absolutely.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.800
So depending on what you're doing with a video,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.320
all of the playback nodes works.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.040
You could do playback position.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.640
Normalized position might be better for that one.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.600
Normalized position outputs the normalized point

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.440
of the video.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.400
So zero is the start of the video,

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.280
one is the end of the video.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.840
So you could do when the normalized position equals one,

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.280
fire on true, clear the string.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.640
There may even be a node for when the video ends.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.560
I don't quite remember.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.640
I'm not in Neos right now,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.200
so I'm not looking at those nodes.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.400
But yeah, basically figure out if the video has stopped

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.960
and then clear the string with the right node.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.240
Easy, easy, easy.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.800
We have a question here from Kazu says,

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.520
recently I often see logs that are running out of space

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.800
when asked by beginners,

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.120
but everyone says they can afford display capacity.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.640
Is there a gap between capacity display

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.720
and the capacity is actually determined

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.400
as a synchronization failure?

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.320
Yes, those things are like delayed a little bit

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.280
from each other,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.920
particularly because if there's an active sync happening,

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.480
then we're able to see how much is coming in

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.720
and maybe stop it because we know that it won't fit

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.760
and stuff like that.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.560
And then sometimes the space display that's on the dash

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.600
is like cached or delayed

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.240
based on the cloud processing the incoming assets.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.320
So those things can get out of alignment sometimes,

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.080
which might be what you're seeing.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.560
Lex actually made a good comment there,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.560
which is he thought that we were talking about local space,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.640
not cloud space.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.760
So Kazu, maybe if you could clarify

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.160
or just direct message me later, we'll take a look at it.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.360
Particularly if you've got the log file

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.240
that was causing the problem,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.800
I can just double check which one of those are.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.280
Moving forwards, Peach has a question.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.480
What is the possibility difficulty

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.680
of integrating programs, plugins, things into Neos?

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.400
Particularly I was about to ask this general

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.560
regarding to playing flash games in virtual arcades.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.040
Okay, so flash is dead.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.600
I know that that's sad.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.680
There are ways to play flash games that exist.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.000
There's like a, I can't remember the name of it.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.760
What that thing, I can't remember the name of,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.480
does though, is it downloads a very old version of Firefox

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.280
and then just goes, here you go, flash works.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.120
That's what it does.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.680
It's quite cool,

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.360
because it lets you sort of relive the nineties,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.480
but flash games inside Neos wouldn't be a thing

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.640
that would probably support.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.520
Now, you're welcome to do that with plugins or mods.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.120
It'll probably have to be a plugin for flash,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.160
but that would be quite an undertaking.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.400
Yes, Linker, you wanna make Neos Plus run flash files?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.280
Go for it.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.760
That'll be out next Tuesday, right?

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.880
We are looking into web assembly later.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.280
There's a GitHub issue for it,

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.000
which would allow you to run things

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.720
in that range a little bit,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.080
but probably not flash itself.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.600
Integrating stuff is basically a mix of,

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.760
are you okay waiting?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.600
In which case, hey, Neos will do it.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.400
And if it's compatible with Neos's ethos,

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.800
development strategy, et cetera, great,

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.080
but you'll have to wait.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.160
Then there is plugins,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.720
which is you can do whatever you want in a plugin.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.160
You can do whatever you want.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.840
You could probably get like a Windows emulator

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.760
into Neos with a plugin.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.200
That'd be very difficult to do,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.200
but you can probably do it.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.200
So you can probably do flash if you would like to,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.280
but it would have to be a...

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.240
Let's take a look down at the next question.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.840
Zach says, why does it take so long to sync a large file?

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.840
Well, I don't know what sort of magnitude

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.040
we're talking at here.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.560
If you're talking about like a gigabyte,

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.240
then it's a gigabyte.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.720
That's why it takes a long time.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.080
Additionally, larger files are large.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.360
Sorry, I completely lost my train of thought.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.400
Large files are large.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.760
That's why it takes so long.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.560
Give you some more details and I'll see what it is.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.560
Like if you said it was taking like three hours

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.880
to sync 500 megabytes, that's a problem.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.720
We could look at that.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.720
If it's like, it takes a long time to sync one gigabyte,

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.840
it's like, eh, it does.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.600
Mr. Square Pig.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.240
No, Square Peg, sorry, to use there.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.840
Will the Pico4 work with Neos?

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.200
I have one on order.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.080
As with all gadgets and headsets,

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.560
the only way that those can work is with a Neos update.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.800
And if we, as in the Neos team, have a development unit

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.200
or sufficiently documented developer documentation

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.360
from the manufacturer, I get the question

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.440
about other headsets, like every single week.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.760
It's like, will you support this unannounced headset

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.160
that some person found in a hotel room and leaked online?

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.600
Not until it's public, no.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.040
And then when it is public, we'll figure out if we can.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.200
But yeah, it needs work to be done.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.120
There are, again, the modding community

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.040
have made certain weirder headsets done.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.440
So if you don't want to wait for us,

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.320
that might be an opportunity.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.200
Moving down to Arisios for live streaming video into Neos.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.840
I have experimented using HLS RTMP and other protocols

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.720
desperately trying to get video and audio to sync on a live

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.800
stream, but all it takes is one avatar to load.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.560
And someone says the audio and video are out of sync.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.280
Do you have any suggestions on what

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.880
we've done to try and keep the audio and video synced?

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.640
I can't remember how we did it in a world,

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:21.720
but there's a property on the video player

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.320
now called playback error sync, something like that.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.320
That one is local, I believe.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.520
And what we did was we hooked up that.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.760
And some sort of comparison, I really can't remember.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.480
I'm pulling stuff out of the bowels of my memory here.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.480
We hooked that up locally to a fire on true,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.960
which would then pause the video temporarily,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.600
wait a couple of updates, and then play it again.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.840
And that seemed to re-sync things automatically.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.540
Of course, it was incredibly frustrating

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.240
because if anyone was out of sync,

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.440
it would pause it.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.800
But we only had it happen two or three times during a video

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.480
that we were watching, so it was OK.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.440
Another time it happened every five seconds,

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.120
and we just turned it off.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.040
That might be something to look at.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.560
Kazu says, local storage, not cloud one.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.840
Let me scroll back up to your question, Kazu.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.600
He's obviously nervous about running our spaces.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.220
Ah, yeah.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.160
So do make sure that they are looking

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.120
at the drive which stores that particular type of data.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.960
So if, which question did I really want to ask?

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.040
Scrolling around.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.280
Local storage.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.880
Oh, not local storage.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.480
Oh, OK.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.000
Thank you.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.640
Thank you.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.360
All right, cool.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.680
I'll just skip that question.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.240
We'll move on.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:39.760
Thank you.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.920
Zach says it stays at 0.0% for 15 plus minutes.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.520
That is a stuck sync, which means

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.760
you need to post a log file and questions and help one.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.600
I'll take a look at it for you.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.120
It could be any number of things until I see that log file.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.440
Another one friendly thing you can do when you encounter

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.280
a problem, by the way, is to provide enough information.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.720
People say, something went wrong.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.960
And I'm like, what went wrong?

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.760
What were you trying to do?

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.480
Just think about how much more information

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.360
could you give us such that we don't

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.780
have to ask you any more questions.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.960
We can just fix your issue.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.160
So start with log file.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.520
Start with a complete description

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.440
of what you are doing.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.200
Start with any information that you have.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.080
That's why the bug report form on the GitHub

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.040
is so long, so we can get all the information.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.320
Let's scroll up and down, look for more questions.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.760
Ozi says, what is Neosis development ethos?

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.040
I think I generally know what it is, but not exactly.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.200
We don't have it exactly written down.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.200
And to be fair, it is basically Frix's ethos as well.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.120
It's like, I guess I can give examples.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.960
Sometimes there's things like a feeling,

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.200
and you can't really describe them.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.440
And this is one of those cases.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.200
There are examples which kind of help you explain it.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.640
One of the most prominent examples

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.120
is one would be as backwards compatible as possible.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.760
So any time we change something, we're

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.360
like, will this break anything in backwards compatibility?

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.080
And if that's the case, then we'll figure it out.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.400
I always use this example of backwards compatibility

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.120
because people see it all the time and ask me about it.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.440
If you are using the find child by name node,

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.760
I think it also does it with the child by tag node.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.960
And you look at your logic.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.960
Sometimes there'll be this slot that has been created

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.840
and just appeared there that says injected

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.680
for backwards compatibility.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:30.840
That one is to add an input's value to the old default value

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.720
because we swapped the default value for one of the inputs.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.440
So when we detect that your find child by name node

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.800
was created before we applied this update,

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.200
we invert that particular option back to the old one

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.040
just in case it would break by being the new option.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.800
That is a really bad way of explaining that.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.520
Anyway, that's an example there.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.440
And then another one would be future proofing,

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.080
which is kind of like backwards compatibility.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.760
You'll see things like collections and stuff

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.560
like that in mods and plugins around.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.160
They are great and fantastic that they're able to do that.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.760
But are they backwards compatible?

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.560
Are they completely integrated with the Nius engine?

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.080
Not sure.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.080
Haven't looked at the code yet.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.440
So I'm not making a judgment here.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.600
I'm saying, are they?

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.840
That's what we would do when we were

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.160
doing those particular features.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.800
We would make sure that we thought out

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.280
end-to-end everything such that we never

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.600
have to really redo that feature like it's done,

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.160
like it's part of Nius.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.280
You'll see other examples.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.760
Basically, if you look at any issue

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.320
that we've closed for like, no, sorry,

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.440
and that is sort of the ethos.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.880
And I know it's annoying sometimes,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.920
but it's just like that's another example where

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.840
it comes up.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.040
Duff says, might have already talked about it before,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.840
but why is it the majority of the community

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.360
usually stays in non-public baseballs more often than not?

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.280
I talk about this in my previous office hours,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.560
so refer to the notes on that one.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.720
I will do the speech again.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.360
I probably had a better speech last time,

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.880
so check that one out.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.000
Easton says, that was an oddly specific example

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.880
of someone finding a VR headset in a hotel room.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.040
That's exactly how the Quest Pro was leaked.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.720
And for about three office hours after that, people are like,

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.120
will you support the Quest Pro?

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.480
It's like, not until we know it actually exists.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.160
I'm like, yeah, we know a leak is confirming

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.600
that the headset exists, but a cardboard box in a hotel room

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.880
is different than a developer platform, and library,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.840
and documentation, and API, and us having

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.160
headset in our hands to test.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.640
Cassie says, do you have any prospects for the years

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.480
to resume development?

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.480
It's been 11 months since the problem happened,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.320
but I'd like to know if there's any progress.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.320
I really don't have anything to say on that one.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.680
There was some information a couple of office hours ago,

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.000
but the summary is, please just check announcements.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I know it's horrible.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.480
There's nothing really I can say,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.360
except we are working as hard as we can on that.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.600
Stifle says, current clock error is the property, I think.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.440
Yeah, that's the one.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.040
So yeah, if you check current clock, clop, clop, clop,

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.200
clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clipperty-clop.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.520
I'm making horse noises.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.840
Anyway, if you check that, I think it's local,

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.960
and then you can fire on true when

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.960
it's above a certain threshold, pause the video,

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.320
and load the video again, or pause it

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.280
and wait a couple of seconds, then load it again.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:15.200
I believe what we did to counter the it kept pausing thing is,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.400
we put a little red light at the corner of the screen that

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.640
turned on when someone was experiencing

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.920
desync using current clock error.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.200
And then we knew that when that light had been on for a minute,

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.120
we knew it was pretty severe desync,

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.920
and then we would manually pause and stop it.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.520
Rampa says, log sanitizer utility

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.120
when for moderation you need full log,

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.160
but posting in the open public, in my opinion,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.360
ain't the best thing, since they're all the item IDs,

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.600
user IDs, et cetera.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.320
So do keep in mind, and I understand

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.560
that if you as an individual have

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.840
a different interpretation of that, that's absolutely fine.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:55.560
Do just keep in mind that Neos doesn't consider some data

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.920
private that might be considered private.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.080
Now these, of course, vary on individual preferences.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.240
Some of these ones I actually disagree with myself,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.960
because we don't consider usernames, user IDs,

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.280
or machine IDs private data.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.320
Those ones I do agree with, because the machine ID is

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.560
randomly generated by us, and it really doesn't mean much.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.840
The username is your username.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.600
It's on your name badge.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.480
And the user ID is usually just your username

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.800
with a U dash on the front of it.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.080
So none of those are private.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.920
So we also don't consider IP addresses private.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.200
I know that other people do.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.600
I kind of do.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.280
But it's kind of not a problem these days, IP addresses.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.480
Yeah, I can find out which city you live in,

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.200
but I do understand that people want

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.520
to strip those from logs, though,

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.960
so do figure that one out.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.280
I don't know if we would do log sanitizing on our part.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.920
We might when we have sort of inbuilt reporting.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.240
I want inbuilt reporting for moderation purposes

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.120
and for bugs and feature purposes,

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.280
like send us feedback.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.440
At that point, we'd be able to sanitize it,

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.160
because we would be the ones getting it.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.200
And then maybe we could sanitize it automatically

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.400
when we post it to the actual public repository.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.480
But the point is, the log file would

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.240
go from your machine, from Neos, to us

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.640
without Discord or GitHub in the middle.

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:15.520
And then that would be less of an issue for sanitization.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.880
But yeah, someone could make a utility that does that.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.360
That would be quite helpful, actually.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.760
I know there are a few mods that do it, but like,

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.480
you know when you need to just do a random thing to a string

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.760
and you go to randomthingtodoofastring.com

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.600
and you do it there.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.880
If I need like a Unicode character, like a font,

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.960
an icon, I need to like decode and code a string,

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.800
there's like websites for all of that stuff.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.720
Someone could make a web-based thing.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.520
And it would run entirely in the browser.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.240
It could just do JavaScript, right,

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.000
that could sanitize a log file.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.400
A bit like NREX's material combiner website tool thing,

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.680
Easton mentions that when you're reporting a bug,

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:58.800
please disable your mods, cannot agree with that more.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.760
I've seen so many log files where it's just like,

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.640
I have no idea what's going on because there's

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.680
like 50 mods in here and I don't even know what half of them do.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.160
On a note from that, if you remember,

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.320
mods are allowed by our modern plugin policy.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.920
But I do have a recommendation there,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.200
which is don't install all of the mods.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.000
I'm seeing a frequent number of users

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.720
who just download every single mod from the Neos modding

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.000
group and install them without really understanding

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.080
what they do.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.560
And then when something goes wrong,

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.640
it's just impossible for them to know what the problem is.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.160
Easton provides a picture of the clock error.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.200
Yep, current clock error right there.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.680
I'd have to double check Ramper with the item ID front.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.000
You said that if you know the item ID, you can spawn it.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.680
Don't think that's true because of various things.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.280
I think if you know the URL to the 7z by sun, you can do it.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.240
But if you know the ID, you can't then look up where it is.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.080
I believe that's all the questions that we have.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:50.600
Oh, hold on.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.320
We have Peach, who's asking, does Neos have plans

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.480
for a Unity translator to make it easier for VRC users

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.160
to import their creations?

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.880
Yes and no.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.600
So we do have a Unity SDK.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.200
It is sort of broken, sort of not broken.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.080
The problem that we have with a Unity translator

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.200
is when we use that phrasing, people think it's ultimate.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.240
It is the ultimate Unity translator.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.560
You throw any old Unity package at it, and it will translate it.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.560
We can't do that because a single Unity package,

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.640
while it might contain stuff that we can use,

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.760
for example, the model we could use, the textures we could use,

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.640
and accessories on that avatar we can use,

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.080
we can't copy over any behavior.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.720
So we can't copy over the animation doodads.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.400
You know how VRC is.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.640
I don't remember the phrase.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.160
Controllers, that's the one.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.800
We can't copy over that.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.720
We can't currently copy over Dynamic Bones or Fizzbones.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.240
Now, we could update the Unity SDK to do that.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.160
But regardless of what we add to that,

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.320
there's always going to be something incredibly weird,

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.960
which is done, that we can't translate.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.920
And so then people will get the impression

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.200
that the Unity translator is just like, does everything.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.880
Yeah, this custom C Sharp script,

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.920
we've transferred it to Logix for you.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.080
It can't do that.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:14.280
So I think Unity, better naming, a better expectation setting

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.320
is needed there.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:20.000
But yes, we do want to make that process easier.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.520
In some regards, though, and this

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.560
is more of a personal note, I really

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.040
do wish more people, when they see that we don't have that,

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.040
would just try anyway.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.700
I have some people who just outright

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.120
will leave Neos when they see that we don't have a Unity

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120
translator.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.080
And it bothers me because I'm like,

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.760
at a certain point in your life, you

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.720
learned how to make a VR avatar.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.360
And that was challenging.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.520
And now when you're faced with a similar challenge,

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:50.880
learning how to make an avatar in Neos, you're like, no.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.440
I don't think I will.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.400
And I don't know.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.460
I just have a personal grievance against people

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.400
who refuse to learn.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:06.040
Sometimes it's like, hey, you learned to tie your shoes

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.120
and walk as a child.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.920
You can learn stuff if you just apply to yourself.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.960
Anyone who says, I have a smooth brain.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.920
I can't learn Logix.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.520
I'm like, please apply yourself.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.560
Please ask the community.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.760
Please try learning, we'll help you out.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.440
Your brain is amazing and is not too thin.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.720
You have the ability to.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.360
So I believe that question is done.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.920
Kazu mentions that some booth items include 7z buttons.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.360
They do.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.680
Do remember that that is on the things to avoid list

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.440
because it can and will break in the future.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.560
Easton, you don't have to tie your shoes.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.840
I'm going to DM you some videos later.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.440
Yeah, I use slip-on shoes these days.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.360
Although when I went on a vacation recently,

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.240
it was actually at my parents' house in Spain.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.860
And I only had one pair of shoes with me, and it broke.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.400
And so I bought two new pairs of shoes

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.640
that actually do have laces because they

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.520
didn't have any of the slip-on shoes they used over there.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.760
But yeah, I've had one pair of shoes for four years,

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.000
and they finally broke.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:02.880
I'm very frugal.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.880
Kazu says that they want to change it to a better

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.200
method when that's provided.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.600
Absolutely fine, I understand.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.360
Every time I see something that might break,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.440
I let you know that it might break just so that it

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.920
stays inside your head.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.000
And you keep in mind that when it breaks,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.440
that we told you that it was going to break.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.240
I believe that's all the questions we have.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.780
If there are any follow-up questions,

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.000
please do direct message me, and I'll go ahead and close off

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.680
the office hours here.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.640
Just let me know if you have any other questions.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.040
Direct message me, ping me on Discord.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.640
Send me a carrier pigeon, hopefully with some treats.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.960
I'll take caribou or cheese.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.200
That's fine.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.060
And I'll see you next year.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:40.680
Next year?

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.000
Next week!

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.720
Not next year.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.320
Promise.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.080
Next week.
