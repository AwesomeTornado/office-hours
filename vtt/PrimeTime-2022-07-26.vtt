WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
Okay, well we are now going to get started. It is 4 p.m. so welcome to

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.440
office hours. This is office hours of me, Probable Prime. I'm a member of the NEOS team and I'm

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.360
gonna answer your questions. As a reminder, which I've been saying like every couple

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.240
of seconds before this, if you have questions please drop them in the office

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.560
hours chat that's two above the one that you're currently in the community

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.080
meetings chat and I'll get to them in the order that they appear and I'll answer them. Let's go ahead

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.560
and take a look. So we have a question from Light Lotus who says what is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.160
happening with NEOS? Why has nothing been said about the state of leadership? It

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.120
has. If you check announcements you'll see the updated information there. If

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.920
there's any additional information we'll share it in announcements. You'll get

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.120
tidbits information randomly from from various members of the team when they

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.560
answer various questions but like no news doesn't mean nothing's happening it

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.000
just means that there's no news. There's like there's a difference there right so

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.800
we can't say nothing's happening and we can't say nothing's not happening we

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.400
just we can't tell you like anything until we can tell you stuff like so no

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.720
news means wait for more news. Thumbs up. Cool.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.160
Moving on ones to Duff's question. Duff says with the huge influx of VLC players

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.760
migrating over to NEOS what the scene what are the what are some of the key

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.520
things we should be teaching new players that the team and all the community

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.080
members would like to emphasize on? I personally and I can't enforce this of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.720
course because it's not on any guidelines it's not me speaking as an

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.600
official capacity is for you to be considerate. There's a lot of sort of you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.560
know cool stuff that you can do inside Neos but being considerate is incredibly

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.360
important. I have a list of ways that you can be considerate on a personal page on

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.080
the Neos Wiki once again this is not like mandated this is not like do this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.000
or you will die this is just my personal opinion about how you can be considerate.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.880
There's also the social videos that exist in my social VR playlist which

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.800
I'll go ahead and link as well. As Shifty says in the comments consent is super

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.000
important there are other social issues which are very important consent being a

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.680
very very large one in that ground. So they would take a look at the social

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.160
videos there and the social videos we have Reading the Room which is about

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.840
basically when you join a Neo session it might be unclear what's happening in

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.240
that Neo session you just take like a couple of seconds you know figure out

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.760
what's happening what type of session is this what type of users are in this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.520
session how best can my existence my energy influence this session. In some

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.520
cases the answer is not at all in which case you can just leave there's nothing

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.720
bad about that you're just like hey it's the wrong session happens all the time

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.120
in over in VRC right you join the 20th black cat of the day to see who's in the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.520
black cat and you're just like well this group are over here listening to

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.340
terrible rap music in the corner in front of a mirror I don't think this is

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.840
the world for me and you go on to the next black cat that's you know exactly

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.080
the same thing happening over here on all Neos if the if the session isn't

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.840
suitable you just just move on VRC for me is like vibe hunting a little bit

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.440
different in Neos because there's you know so much more you can do but in VRC

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.840
I mostly vibe hunt I'm like I'm looking for a particular vibe usually just chill

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.520
and not terrible rap music yeah there's also the myths list actually I do want

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.800
to cover that one so misinformation is rampant and so if someone comes up to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.120
you and they say something on the lines of I heard this or he said this or she

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.400
said that or I heard this or the dev said this no they're doing this etc do

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.720
check that miss list it's not exhaustive there are other ones there those are

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.480
just the myths that like they they ground my gears on that day that I wrote

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.320
that page at the wiki is a community project feel free to add more myths to

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.240
that page additionally I have a screenshot from our friends and I say

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.920
that because we should be working together as you know social metaverses I

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.480
have a screenshot of a message from the VR chat team which I just want to like

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.520
signal boost here in a way that I know out it's my office hours which is like

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.200
hey do what you can to combat misinformation as well like a lot of

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.020
sessions I was in I would say 20 to 30 percent there were some people in the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.520
corners or sometimes just blatantly talking about it they're like oh yeah

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.480
like you know VR just stealing credit card information now and it's like well

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.440
what is the like what is the source of your information like oh you heard it

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.080
from a friend okay where did they hear it from Oh friend and you trace it all

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.000
the way back and it's just like they read an offhand comment somewhere that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.480
doesn't make sense like if you go direct to the source you'll get more information

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.920
there so there we go moving forwards let's take a look at more questions

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.440
Jin says question is anyone team set up a hardware wallet part of the principle

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.760
of cryptocurrency is anonymity and I don't understand why this doesn't exist

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.920
anymore my crypto wallets are incredibly secret I'm not going to tell you what

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.280
they are where they are who they are how many I have what they have on them

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.200
that's not the goal of crypto right the goal of crypto is that there is a level

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.760
of anonymity to it sharing information about my wallets publicly is problematic

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.320
and I don't know why we've got to that point I don't know why we have those

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.280
domain names you can link to a wallet address and be like yo you can see all

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.240
my bank transactions you can see much cheese I'm buying right so I have a

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.280
counter question to that which is could you please provide a transaction history

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.320
of your entire bank account over the last millennia and I'll take a look at

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.520
that and find all the weird stuff that you've purchased moving on to their next

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.720
question T asks what are the plans going forwards in regards to influx of ERC

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.000
players we actually scaled quite well we got some comments actually from this

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.160
these groups as well so we have two volunteer groups within the the Neos

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.120
community and the largest sort of Neos team is an umbrella term called the

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.920
mentors and moderators moderators are responsible for guideline violations and

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.480
and just sort of keeping things in check and I want to say police because they

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.920
aren't police right they're not beat cops they're not gonna arrest you they

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.280
don't have tasers they don't have firearms they're there to just try and

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.480
make sure everyone's safe and if there's issues that come up they're there to try

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.440
and resolve them and then there's the mentors and there is a lot of overlap

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.560
between this the mentors are a volunteer group that are designed to help you out

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.960
with inside Neos now it is not correct to say that if you're not a mentor you

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.000
can't help anyone and everyone can help at any time I was in MTC sessions

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.040
yesterday helping out and I'm a team member I had one person and one person

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.560
only who direct messaged me and said should you be working on the actual

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.240
platform rather than helping out new users and I just said no I didn't want

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.040
to entertain that with any other answer right we had an influx of new users we

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.800
needed as many people as we could so I was helping out new users I think I'm

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.840
entitled to do that those groups were scaled a lot sort of earlier on in the

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.040
year we scaled them a lot we added a lot more to them and and like I said even

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.040
from some of those people inside those groups they're like only scaling too

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.640
much like don't we have too many mods or too many mentors based on yesterday no

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.200
we have quite frankly enough or in some cases not enough like it was it was very

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.080
very very busy so we scaled quite well for those and we'll probably continue

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.800
scaling if we see additional upticks such that they can grow and scale as the

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.800
as the platform grows and scales for information on the mentor program which

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.440
is I don't to say free to join because that makes it sound like it's some sort

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.920
of paid service but like it is you know it is anyone can join it anyone can

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.440
become a mentor and remember if you're not a mentor you can still help it's

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.520
just like hey if you want to go that extra mile and become a mentor then you

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.000
can go ahead and become a mentor there's information on mentors when I can spell

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.960
it correctly here and there's also information on the moderation team

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.120
moderation team is a little bit more difficult to join because it's a

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.120
different level of commitment that's there actually don't think we have

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.360
moderation applications open currently but there we go

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.800
additionally there's also this lovely page I wrote called how to help which

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.560
talks about the ways that you can help us do cool stuff so there you go there's

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.480
how to help I know there's lots of links today but that's because I have written

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.680
a lot of those pages or collaborate on those pages with the community and they

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.400
just have so much information you'll see a lot of repeated questions in the in

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.560
the discord and we're fine to answer repeated questions of course but hey if

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.980
you're if you're nervous about asking questions or you think it might be a

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.960
silly question it's not but also remember the information is on the the

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.680
wiki there as well and if there is information on the wiki that you think

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.000
is missing go ahead and edit it anyone can edit it anyone on the planet your

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.120
mother your father your grandfather your aunt your cousin your dog anyone who can

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.600
access a keyboard can edit the wiki no permission is required if you want to

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.720
edit the wiki and feel like contributing then there is a page called contributing

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:26.040
to the wiki which can also help like I said lots of links here it's linked down

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:33.960
all right let's go ahead and move onwards let's take a look okay so we got

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.560
that one whoever's reacting with cues can you also get thank you for adding

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.400
the the checkmarks are you but it's Lex today thank you so much I do want to

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.560
double check I know who's doing it every day so we got dust question we got the

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.920
hardware quality question and we got takes question onto hacks question access

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.200
so a good way of handling syncing to inventory or things loading into the

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.840
world and it's recently it's been a bit slower than usual with making things to

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.600
appear making it harder to help people put their avatars together there was

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.840
some server load issues yesterday because quite frankly we didn't know

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.120
that we were going to get a larger like a scale event we have now adjusted our

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.480
infrastructure to handle that scale event including the registration cap

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.200
which may seem annoying for questions about the registration cap do ask I

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.440
won't go into it unless there's an ask though because I could talk about it for

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.040
like 20 minutes and I don't want to waste that time so if you're interested

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.920
please go ahead and ask um so we are adjusting things to make that a little

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.400
bit better what I would say there is if you are helping people out consider

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.480
using a more performant avatar I don't want to say look like it's a mentor even

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.800
if you're not a mentor but I don't want to say as a helper you need a uniform

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.720
because you don't need to abide by guidelines of course but like maybe a

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.920
lighter avatar might help because then when you're joining the session to help

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.760
them you're then not em what's the word for like burdening that's the word

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.440
you're not burdening that session with your avatar you're you're just giving a

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.560
light thing for your presence your character and then everything else

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.760
spawned in is targeted for them then that will give like a little bit less

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.000
load on that session steam randomly just disconnected from the internet that's

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.840
fine and jump scared me on my computer and then other than that is just just

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.800
think about what you're spawning there are some items that can also be created

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.160
without using the inventory for example if you add like a developer tooltip

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.040
component to an empty object it should automatically create a cone it'll be old

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.600
red cone rather than the new sort of gold sparkly dev tip but it still works

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.280
same with the logic step it will create a blue cone for you so can also be like

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.560
an emergency thing we still noticing issues do please continue reporting them

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.280
we do like seeing those we can do more I mean can we do want to hear about that

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.560
if there's any problems all right let's move forwards to TPW use question hi

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.400
TPW I see that you're new to the discord so welcome to Neos as was TK actually so

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.080
welcome to the discord as well while Neos has great tools for developers one

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.440
thing that turns new people that aren't tech savvy is the complexity of the base

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.000
menu especially with the influx of VLC players is there any vision of

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.520
streamlining things where it remain pretty much the same it will be like

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.400
night and day eventually so what we want to do is initially we want to first of

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.400
all replace all the old UI with new UI easy way to explain that is actually

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.880
using dark mode and light mode anything that is in light mode right now and that

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.240
includes inspectors because those are light it needs to be like entirely

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.080
reworked in some cases from the ground up to be in our new UI system there's UI

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.800
which is the old UI system and then UI X which is the new UI system once that's

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.520
all reworked it will have an initial pass which will improve the UI the UX

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.200
design of those those units initially but it also allow us to continue

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.560
developing that UI further in response to feedback from you guys and ideas

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.880
suggestions enhancements added to that because of the way that we build our new

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.960
UI it is entirely customizable as an example here to kind of illustrate

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.960
what's going on the world browser which is in the new UI scheme there's more

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.920
work that we need to do on the UI on the world browser for sure but it is in the

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:13.960
new UI system that is entirely editable by you as an example of that there is a

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.800
facet I made which is a simplified world browser that just shows the worlds that

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.400
you're in allows you to close out of them it's probably the most popular

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.680
thing I've made in a long time another example and I don't know if I can

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.480
remember the name of the world there is I think that's called Nexus portal I

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.400
should actually visit that last night seemed crazy something like that it's a

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.400
world that I made where I took the world browser and I made it 3d again and so I

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.000
made each world that is in the world browser as an active session a like

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.440
doorway in this like grassy knoll floating in space and it used to be

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.960
quite easy to make that render because there wasn't that many sessions open but

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.960
it'll probably be a mess these days but again that's just me editing the world

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.920
browser added to that parts of the world browser actually generic so for example

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.400
the search bar there's nothing in that search bar that determines that it's

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.200
searching worlds the search bar just says this is what's in my search query

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.760
and the world browser then picks that up using sort of interrupt between those

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.560
segments and it means that they can sort of be dragged around a little bit what

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.120
I'm basically saying there about rambling on too much more is once the UI

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.280
is over to the system you build it yourself hey you want an inspector

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.120
that's bright pink you can build it yourself hey you want an inspector that

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.280
is in still in light mode even if we default to dark mode go for it you want

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.920
an inspector with different font go for it you want a bigger font size go for it

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.800
want a small font size go for it people already do this they create custom

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.840
inspectors and feel free to continue using those but once we have that new

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.400
system in place for inspectors it'll be a lot easier to do that and it'll be a

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:41.120
lot less prone to errors and issues so and a short summary everything's gonna

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.120
change like honestly it's gonna look like you put you know your ducks and

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.160
your whites together in the laundry machine and it's come out like a

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.800
completely new garment and you're just like cool yes I now have a grey t-shirt

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.000
instead of a white t-shirt moving forwards let's take a look at what is

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.240
next okay so neko gama has a not a question just something I'd like to

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.880
bring to attention since I'm since I'm since I mentioned the miss list neko was

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.960
recently asked by decent our friends if Neos is owned by Facebook due to the

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.080
term metaverse just want to give a quick heads up I don't like this and there's

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.920
nothing I can really do about it asking whether Neos is owned by Facebook is

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:29.600
kind of the same as asking if any book that you own in your library of books on

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.560
your bookshelf is owned by Facebook because it's got the word book in it and

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.040
I understand the confusion and I wish that Manta hadn't chosen that particular

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:44.520
name but that's just the way that we were in the world that we live in Neos

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.060
is not owned by Facebook if it was we would have to declare it and if we

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.920
declared it it would be on the bottom of our website and it would probably be a

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.320
part of the UI and hey maybe you'd need a Facebook account to log into Neos so

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.720
we are not very easy to prove that I will add it to the miss list I would

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.200
also encourage those that have that kind of thought process to look beyond words

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.960
and and finding associations for that so the the word meta that's in metaverse

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:16.200
just means like different or adjunct to the normal thing so there's a good

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.200
example there being meta data so metadata is data about the data so a

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.040
good example of metadata is a picture that you saved to your computer the

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.640
picture which might be of your favorite cheese collection is a picture that's

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.680
the data there's computer you know code or binary on that computer which is

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.600
describing what that cheese collection looks like but then there's meta data

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.840
which is when you took the picture what like focus and zoom that camera was and

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:46.600
etc and that metadata also isn't owned by Facebook it's meta data additionally

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.760
there is a company called meta threads who I'm vaguely aware of because I used

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.720
to be in the streaming area as a job and they had really good outfits and

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.840
clothing they're probably angry right now and there was another company that I

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.400
believe currently is suing meta because the use of the name but I don't want to

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.200
comment on that because it's not like a good place to sort of comment on the

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:12.860
affairs of other companies scrolling down to another question Alexios says

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.720
and UI streamlining is desperately needed but you know the situation after

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.400
us is there any team members working developed at all or is everyone in the

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.360
protest thing it is difficult to use the word protest I've heard some people use

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.160
the word strike it isn't either of those we have stopped working because of

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.560
negotiations currently it is not a strike it is not a protest if it was a

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.200
strike or a protest I wouldn't be here speaking to you if you strike from let's

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.040
say a factory job you don't go to the factory if you strike from a programming

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.680
job you don't program and you don't attend the job we have everyone in here

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.200
like I saw shifty typing shifty has some messages I saw Canadian get typing

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.360
there's probably got messages from them on the scroll list but I keep the scroll

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.660
to the questions I'm answering so yeah we're still working but we're working in

00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:00.680
other areas depends what you what you mean there is still stuff happening it's

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.920
just we're not releasing updates currently moving forwards to the next

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.000
question that's exactly the same question from index there yeah news is

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.440
still being developed we're still working we're just not releasing updates

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.080
Jin has updated the question hardware alerts which says I only want to know if

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.360
the news team takes seriously security seriously with hardware wallet questions

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.120
most crypto teams devs marketplace recommended hardware to users to protect

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.400
themselves based on a confidence of any on the team took it serious and an

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.440
advocate of such I am an advocate of hardware is and if you ask me what I

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.040
recommend you store your cryptocurrency on I would say a hardware wallet what

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.720
that's a different question though that's hey prime what would you

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.880
recommend to increase the security of your Neos account and I would say hey go

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.160
ahead turn on 2fa make sure you have a password not using on any other site and

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.400
when you create and turn on 2fa make sure you save those backup codes a part

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.920
of turning on the 2fa process will ask you to save the backup codes and I know

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.480
some people don't if you don't save your backup codes and you lose your 2fa

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.400
device you kind of screwed so when a computer tells you to save backup codes

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.500
and this is any platform of 2fa if they present backup codes to you you save

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.960
them so yeah I we are security serious like we have a security policy for

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.440
reports and security etc we take it very secure it's very securely we take

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.000
security very seriously was I was trying to say and we have a lot of looking

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.720
insight and information that we're looking at as security grows what that

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.900
doesn't mean is that I need to talk to you about my personal life or my

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.240
personal crypto wallets that is a bad measure if my front door has no lock on

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.760
it it doesn't mean that my code is insecure it just means that I'm

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.760
replacing my front door actually have a friend who's replacing their front door

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.040
it blew open in the wind and got wrecked and they bought the wrong size door so

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.520
they had to return it I'm like I didn't think that was like a thing that could

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.520
happen but it was a thing most the wrong size handle I can't remember anyway they

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.240
had to replace their door and it was a big sort of spectacle because you know

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.240
you need to get a door the right size moving onwards um it has an update on

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.240
moderation team which has applications on an as no-kneader basis fantastic get

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.360
also mentions that needing new mods would be identified like different

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.880
languages different locale stuff like that that would be good to see if you

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.560
haven't seen it already if you looked at the Twitter hashtag we have a large and

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.160
I mean quite large representation in the Japanese area Japanese locale Japanese

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.240
language they are fantastic they do some of the amazing things take a look at the

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:37.040
MMC 2021 2022 2019 it should just look at all the MMCs for crazy creations

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.720
from that community the same goes for Korean as well we have a lot of Korean

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.640
users that are amazing I have since some sort of rumblings of Spanish which is

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.840
cool so we've been looking into like that I know that we have a Spanish badge

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.080
we sometimes give out to people or actually don't know anyone that's with

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:59.000
I've not seen it um but yeah if you are in a growing area of language or locale

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.600
that you think that we might need we'll take a look and have a look at it

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.980
we haven't seen it as well we have built by the Japanese community actually we

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.040
have some translation devices where you can basically just like stick them to

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.200
your head and then when you speak the translator text in whatever language you

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:18.240
want will appear above your head and it's beautiful moving forwards to other

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.720
questions which is maybe we have another one from neko thank you for that I did

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.000
want to ask one thing I noticed is a bit of performance for high use accounts by

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.400
hardware not being even halfway utilized is this more of a network ish or

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.720
something bigger the force in the US is a very complicated beast I'll call it a

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.360
beast because it's one that the nearest team are going to tackle with multiple

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.360
tools and implements there are a lot of things that we just haven't done when it

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.360
comes to optimization and we plan to do one of those being we want to optimize

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.160
the IK a little bit and then another one being hey want to optimize entirely the

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.640
renderer by replacing it which will get us some optimizations we also want to

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.080
optimize the language that Neos is written in and by that I mean we want to

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.080
change the version of dotnet we're using which gives us again performance

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.840
improvements just simply because hey we're compiling to a different target so

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.140
there's a lots of things that we need to do there it is something that we know is

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.440
a is a miss on our part is that we can't have worlds with as bigger numbers as

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.200
other platforms but do know that we are taking a look at it if you want to know

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.800
what you can do to kind of mitigate that the the biggest thing you can do is get

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.400
out of an avatar that has full IK we call them head and hands avatar

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.120
sometimes they're called flatties I don't particularly like that one because

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.200
my head and hands avatar isn't flat but if you remember the default avatar that

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.880
you had when you came into Neos when you were creating your account before you

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.160
set up your avatar it just had hands and that floating headset you can create as

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.640
like those using basically anything if you import a bench a park bench into the

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.240
game you can go to avatar creator slap the headset the head part of the avatar

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.560
create on that concrete bench hit create avatar and you'll have a head and hands

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.480
avatar that looks like a bench with hands those are more performant I don't

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.320
want to tell you to do that all the time or say like you must do that because

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.720
again you lose the character there you lose the full body tracking you lose the

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:09.040
legs you know you lose the chest so it's it's up to you and then in addition to

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.400
that is to make sure that you're watching whatever you're spawning in good

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.760
often examples there being video players trying to keep video players low I've

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.080
noticed a couple of people will do the sort of thing where they like they'll

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.320
spawn in videos and just kind of like cue them up like a deck of cards each

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.920
video player is causing like quite a lot of performance problems so like just

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.760
try and keep that down that isn't a big contributor to performance but when you

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.160
got like you know a deck of cards of ten waiting videos to play yeah lots of

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.400
other things there you have a specific questions about what you need to

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.820
optimize do let me know so moving onwards Sven oh second it's not Sven

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.200
second I've been pronouncing that one right so second asked her to confirm on

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.200
blend shapes if they are zero are they still a performance problem is only when

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.840
they have a value if they're on zero they have a performance problem if they

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.960
exist they have a performance problem the performance problem occurs because

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.640
we need to load data into various parts of Neos that determine what will happen

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.560
if that blend shape changes so a good example here and it's a really silly one

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.920
I wish I you know but it's a really good example is there are a lot of avatar

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.820
bases which have a I mean I'm gonna like generalize here a little bit apologize

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.840
for that they kind of have a male female slider it might be boobs it might be

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.760
butts right but you can change the presentation of the avatar to be male

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.700
presenting or female presenting if you have made the decision about what you

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.040
want that character the avatar to be that blend shape needs to not exist and

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.800
you can do that by baking your blend shapes I'll go ahead and link that

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.460
tutorial in the in the chat here what that does is it takes the current

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:40.080
position of all those vertices with that blend shape applied and then applies it

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.620
to the the base blend shape or the basis if you've made a blend of terminology

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.680
and then it deletes that blend shapes would no longer needs to exist and what

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.320
that does is it signals to the to the engine to Neos hey I'm not going to

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.800
change wherever or not I have breasts anymore in this avatar I have locked

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.120
that choice in and again I'm not saying that that needs to be permanent if you

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.240
save two copies of the avatar one that has those blend shapes baked and one

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.880
that doesn't then the one that has those blend shapes baked is more performant

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.680
and if you ever want to change those slides again you can load the unperformant

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.960
one and then make those changes I'm searching YouTube for Baker blend shapes

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.840
and I got some very weird results I need to go to my youtube channel and search it

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:25.760
there like how to bake a cake no bake your blend shapes not a cake here we are

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:34.280
moving moving forwards to an additional question where I scroll the scroll the

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.720
scroll the scroll the scroll toy says a bit of an off-topic question any cool

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.120
hardware it's popping up that's got your attention lately I'm still a streamer at

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.360
heart I used to stream a lot I don't anymore but I am like really wise to the

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.120
streaming hardware area the coolest piece of hardware in that area that I

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.320
bought recently not recently it was actually like almost a year ago now but

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.320
I still love it every day the reason it comes to mind is because the place I

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.120
bought it from was like a local store because they had it in stock and Amazon

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.960
didn't and that store like still every like six months sends me a little letter

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.680
with their catalog attached and just says like thanks for being a customer

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.240
here's our catalog in case you need anything else and it's just like it is

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.960
like slightly annoying but also kind of cute as a company doing that but anyway

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.760
so yeah it's the go XLR mini it's what I'm actually talking to you on I like

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.240
it is every day I don't use it to its full advantage but like it solved a very

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.720
big issue I had with microphones so that was cool as for new hardware more in the

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:39.160
realms of the like VR space I'm a backer a backer I'm a pre-order of the

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.480
ettie controllers and I'm really interested in trying them because I I

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.520
think I might like the feel I don't know if I'll actually like them but I

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.120
pre-ordered them so I'm kind of like biased to be like I want to try them

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.320
just in case I've let you know waste my investment here unfortunately the ettie

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.600
controllers have had a couple of production delays they are very

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.620
understandable it is very difficult to get a new product to market when you

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.760
need to build circuit boards and also like the actual plastic that goes around

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.040
that so I am patient with them and I'm excited to see what they can do with

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.840
them we do have limited support for an earlier version of the ettie controllers

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.000
they will probably need to be additional work when they're the ettie controllers

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.520
in their final state arrives but I will be quite motivated to do that seeing as

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.960
I'll have them lying in my apartment let's move along why the Duff says why

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.600
do people from VRC keep asking if they need to buy dinner bones for Neos this

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.460
is an unfortunate naming problem that we have so when it comes to Neos we have

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:44.000
dynamic bones that are very very very similar to VR chats fizz bones and VR

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.120
chats dynamic bones which actually aren't owned by VR chat long story but

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:52.280
you know like we have very similar things but they are completely different

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.000
so if you want to draw a Venn diagram there is like no overlap in terms of

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.680
code like VR chat fizz bones completely different from dynamic bones the asset

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:07.680
library thing and then our dynamic bones completely separate from both of those

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.840
other two the problem there that then happens is because dynamic bones are

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.160
called dynamic bones in Neos they think that they are the same thing and that's

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.640
quite perfect like it's it's a perfect mistake and a confusion to have and

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.920
that's why they ask if they need to buy it if you are a member of our community

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.360
please get a banner get on a horse and charge into the sunset with a giant

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.160
banner dynamic bones on Neos are free the reason why they're named dynamic

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.560
bones or close to that language is because of the opposite of that we

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.760
didn't want to name them something really obscure because then people would

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.280
have the opposite problem they wouldn't feel that they're familiar they wouldn't

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.960
know how to talk about them etc that's also the case with the case with fizz

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.400
bones right whenever I think about fizz bones which is what PRC uses now I'll

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.920
find myself calling them dynamic bones just because it's in my vocabulary even

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.000
though they're completely different you need to call things what they are and

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.960
that association has power and so therefore calling them dynamic bones has

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.240
power I added them to a couple of avatars yesterday and I said like

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.560
there's lots of controls here you know you can do what you want they are quite

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.240
similar but they are different and the user is helping took a look at the

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.520
inspector panel for the dynamic bones and when I could work with this it looks

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.760
quite similar and they just were off and playing with the dynamic bones and that

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.960
was perfect and yes just clarifying that dynamic bones was a paid add-on for the

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.800
ERC made by someone who doesn't have any investment they're not employed or

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.680
anything at VR excuse me at VRC they just need they're just it was just an

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.200
add-on you could buy I know a lot of people didn't buy it and that makes me

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.160
sad but I do wish I could buy I don't know interview the original creator and

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.680
be like did you know that this add-on was gonna be used for it was being used

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.560
for because I don't think they did like they made it a long time ago moving on

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.360
with lots of questions here we will run over if there's still questions go and

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.000
it is a busy day because of the new influx so don't worry about that we'll

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.560
just we'll just keep keep on keeping on if I get to the bottom of the list and

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.160
we're starting to run a bit dry I'll let you know so on to egg roll force that's

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.080
a crazy username that sounds like I don't know if you know the video game

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.480
series EDF earth defense force it sounds like you'll be right at home playing

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.240
that one so egg roll force ask is there a best practices for hosting instances

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.040
specifically for running more sandboxing instances on a headless yes first thing

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.360
I would say there is have rules so we do have guidelines you'll see get like

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.080
basically banging a drum about guidelines I do as well those are the

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.280
guidelines which are platform global right we don't care what type of session

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.840
you're in you need to be following those guidelines when it comes to hosting your

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.320
own sessions you can add rules to that so it would be perfectly acceptable for

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.760
you to run a headless which had a rule which said no yellow things and then

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.160
fruits wouldn't be able to join perfectly acceptable weird but perfectly

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.280
acceptable so do come up with list of rules for your session if you want

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.800
recommended rules like I said keep the video players down don't build on spawn

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.280
I hate it when people build on spawn move away from spawn to build people

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.760
don't want to spawn into your creations and then other rules like that you can

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.680
see some example rules in the MTC we recently added them because we needed to

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.960
like add some couple more rules to the MTC we'll just join a couple of

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.200
headlaces to do that I might write up an article on like some other rules I would

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:18.040
generally have it's just a little bit like wordy to go into as for a sandbox

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.880
the incidents do know that it's gonna crash a lot if it's on a headless it's

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.560
gonna crash a lot you're gonna need to probably like make sure it's got like an

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.640
auto-restart or something like that if it's sandbox see as in people can do

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.600
whatever they want it will just accidentally crash that won't happen if

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.360
like only certain people can build only friends can or a limited audience but

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:39.640
anyone can build the chances of crashing is like it's gonna be higher as for

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.760
hosting instances personally if you are a host in the world rather than on a

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:48.680
headless your unfortunate job is to sort of be a gatekeeper of that session if

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.600
you notice problems particularly problems involving the guidelines please

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.360
enact self-moderation that's where you can sort of kick or ban someone from a

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.240
session report stuff that happens we love tickets we're not gonna like

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.360
penalize you for making a ticket that isn't good or isn't spelt right or

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.120
anything like that if something happens let us know we'll take a look at it but

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.320
do remember that like you have a little bit of responsibility as the session

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.440
host to kind of keep keep things to how you'd want them to happen imagine that

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.520
the session is your house and the people are coming around to visit if someone

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.800
comes around to visit and they spread dirt all around the floor or horse me

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.840
that was the meaning for the previous one they spread horsemen you're all

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.040
around your apartment you've kicked them out the apartment so do the same for

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.800
your session please if they come in with a loud obnoxious firearm again you'd

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.680
probably call the police and get them arrested so maybe do that in your

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.440
session unless it's like a I don't know gun range session in which case hey

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:46.680
fine so next question from is it a set so is it a thesis I'm kind of our shy

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.400
for asking questions in a large group being a new players and I think that'll

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.240
make my experience best when I finally get into Neos actually um I have a great

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.000
example of that which is about attitude so I've seen great attitude from the

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.280
people I've recently been helping but in the past I have had a couple of problems

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.040
with a little bit of attitude so when I say attitude I don't mean the way that

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.480
like a school teacher would tell you like oh you need to have the right

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.440
attitude to learn I just mean the right mental model to go into Neos right so

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.080
when you go into Neos as a VR chat player or as any other platform player

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.440
coming across you're going to sort of try and make a lot of comparisons you're

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.920
gonna try and be like well it's like this over on VR see it's like this or

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.800
Neos what I want you to do is is try and sort of see beyond that and have

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.200
patience and understand that we have a little bit of dust going on right now

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.680
you know if I could wear a hard hat I'd probably be wearing a hard hat right so

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.440
some stuff is confusing some stuff is unclear some stuff is more complicated

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.880
we've got people all around that are gonna help you out look for the the

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.040
green icon above anyone's head if you're in an MTC session that they'll probably

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:52.360
be there and then above all else is just like ask questions if you got them like

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.360
I will answer the same questions all day if I need to like if it helps you go

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.800
through it if you're shy and you don't want to speak using your microphone we

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.480
have a number of tools available inside the Neos Essentials folder called the

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.680
Mute Helper that lets you type text-based messages which will appear in

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.400
a speech bubble next to your head and that's a great sort of advantage to many

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.000
many people who are for whatever reason and there's no judgment here don't feel

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.600
comfortable talking that's absolutely fine you know was fantastic for that

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.480
also remember that everyone had to learn at one point I'm just rambling here if

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.680
you like the rambling cool if you don't let me know my first session in Neos I

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:34.120
was in an avatar tool world by a user called business lawyer Nexlin came in

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.320
and there was a cart like a sort of metal cart in this world he he'd

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.560
selected with the inspector and scaled it I'm just like whoa and I spent the

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.360
next like week or so just completely confused I had no idea how anything

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.600
worked and so everyone had to learn even me that was like two three years ago but

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.360
I everyone has to learn Duff has a statement as well which is be kind ask

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.800
questions and know that you're generally in a helpful community yep it's good

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.400
advice as well I'll also take a look at the guidelines I hate you know banging a

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.720
drum about them but like the guidelines do have some important information

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:08.080
they're good for you as a person just to know what's unacceptable to do but it's

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.760
also good for you to know what we value right the guidelines show what Neos

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.080
values in a community so we value people being nice to each other because it's on

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:21.360
that guidelines to not be not nice and do again make tickets if you see

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.000
problems we love tickets tickets are a great source of substance for us moving

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.800
forwards Nash has a question which is how easy would it be in port my avatar

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.640
do I just drop in to adapt do I just drag and drop the FBX I've ever done it

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:38.120
before in a lot of cases you are like a little bit ahead of the game because

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.200
what we start with usually with with with VRC players or platform players is

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.240
they don't know where their FBX is that's perfectly fine if you know where

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.320
your FBX is you're already at like step two so you're already having an easier

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.760
time then then someone who doesn't know where their FBX is drag and drop your

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.640
FBX into the game you've got to click a few buttons it is a little bit of an

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.680
evolved process someone can show you it or there are tutorials available which

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.080
I'm sure people can sort of point and take a look at gray has linked one for

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.240
example just underneath the question and it will import things that might not

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.680
work when you import things are things like textures materials and in some

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.600
cases as well rigging there are subtle differences between the way that unity

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.320
is able to rig a humanoid and Neos is able to rig a humanoid but depending on

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.880
which avatar you're using it's absolutely fine I'm gonna take a look at

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.120
your profile picture here and assume that she'll be out your avatar if it's

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:32.280
so probably be fine I think I recognize that one from being imported do just

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.960
take it slow ask questions and you'll be there it is not impossible people

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.360
import all sorts of stuff Corey asks will there ever be will there eventually

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.120
be a wiki page and the recommended avatar optimizations yes it's on my list

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.800
to write I just don't wanna get it wrong so I am like writing it and editing it

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:55.160
and writing it and editing it and then waiting to send it to fruits or or gains

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.360
so gains is our graphics program ideals of all the rendering and fruits just

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.960
knows everything about Neos because they wrote a lot of it I want to say like

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.760
most of it but these days like it's a little bit untrue because like hey I

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:10.080
write code gains rights code you know it's it's cool they know like a lot

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.120
fruits knowledge is insane you just be like this component you wrote three

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:21.480
years ago and they're like oh yeah that one it does this let's move on Corey has

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.840
an interesting statement which says it's tedious to import an avatar I agree that

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.480
the first few avatars that you import are going to be tedious and that's a bit

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.280
that I was talking about with that attitude if you come up with an attitude

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:36.320
of this is tedious I am bored I'm I'm fed up then you won't get it done but

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.740
becoming an attitude like hey this is gonna be a bit tedious this might be a

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:44.780
little bit confusing and you get it done they're like four fifth sixth avatar you

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.680
import it'll be much easier the first couple they are gonna be a little bit

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:54.740
tedious let's move on does this can we empathize that you can use f8 to swap

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:59.120
between VR and desktop mode assuming you stop yeah I told that to a user

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:04.320
yesterday and they were like mind blown it was crazy to just elaborate that on a

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.600
little bit if you start in VR mode that start the game in VR mode right you know

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.360
if you use base stations they start wearing your headset turns on you can

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:16.720
just focus the window on your desktop like with your headset off push f8 and

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.140
you'll be in desktop mode push f8 again you'll be back in desktop no VR

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.960
whichever way around it was that I was talking there is no need to restart if

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.820
you start in desktop mode you cannot switch to VR mode you have to start in

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.080
VR mode to do that switch myself and many others of the community we always

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.200
start in VR mode and there are some days where I started VR mode instantly f8 to

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.160
desktop mode and then never f8 back my headsets just like lying there on its

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.140
like usual resting spot on my desk and it's just like play with me and I'm

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:53.440
like not today it's like but I'm on like not today I'm f8 let's move along

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.000
Lupo says is there any word or timeline for the solve of the issues from anyone

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.560
the reason we're not pushing updates it will talk about it in announcements when

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.080
we talk about it I said it earlier but like if there is no announcement in

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.200
announcements don't assume nothing's happening just assume we can't talk

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.960
about it yet and says you've got a lot of people listening to you rabbi about

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.520
so these stuff today else took about your door earlier that you're replacing

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.240
moving forwards Jin asks is Nia is looking alternative rendering engines

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:28.520
such as web 3js or Godot we are looking into other engines not 3js and not Godot

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:33.400
we were looking into they're all called silly names so I've forgotten them all

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.840
all right now we're sort of working on our own rendering engine as a separate

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:43.680
project it's called sauce not sauce the half-life 2 on the sources in like

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:48.480
tomatoes sauce I honestly don't know a lot about it and that's because my

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.080
strengths don't allow in the rendering side of things that's more kind of like

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.320
easy question to go over gains did used to do office hours they're just sort of

00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:03.080
on hold right now but it will not be Godot or 3js or unreal that's like

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.640
another common question yet we will not be unreal before it says can we hit

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.000
hundred people in primetime I don't know if you can make it happen go for it I'm

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.880
too busy scrolling down asking questions I'm looking at my scroll bar it's just

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:18.960
continually going oh let's keep going fuzzy says last I need for Japanese

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.720
makers they make amazing things but usually very optimized I've seen some

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.920
advancements in that the the biggest part about the the Japanese community

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.920
that I like is how fast they are I have no idea how they do it and how fast they

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.800
do it they're also incredibly well organized so when they start our project

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:38.440
it just sort of like happens and it's insane and I love that about them and so

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.280
there's any optimization issues I'm sure they're working on them Quincy I think I

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:48.680
saw you in nears if I'm remembering that name hello again a translation device

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:54.720
would love to find that where can I get one essential tools essential tools JP

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.080
tools and then in there is the translator I don't know which row it's

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:04.800
on or anything like that but you're looking for a red and white rectangle I

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.200
know that's not useful and I apologize on behalf of nears that we don't have

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.360
search yet but it is in there I do have a version I'm working on that's sort of

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.400
working but mine is just an edit and I do have a video about that on my channel

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.200
but I do always want to point to the original source as well because they

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.080
deserve all the credit they figured it out I just have tweaked it a little bit

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:28.240
to make it easier for my purposes shifty states IK is incredibly optimized more

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.280
particularly as minimizing cost of slot transforms in the data model I thought

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.640
there was something we want to do out okay I might be out of date yeah anyway

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.920
the point there being an optimization is there is stuff that you can do which

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.440
will make a wiki page for and there is stuff that the nears team can do which

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.520
we need we know that we need to work on so that has another question fantastic

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:51.480
which says Disney is having hard limits in terms of avatars of worlds not that I

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.180
can think of there's nothing stopping you from importing a like million

00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:00.240
polygon avatar but it will lag people out and they'll hate you for it there's

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.280
also nothing stopping you from doing that on the world level and again it

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.800
will lag people out and they'll they'll hate it and they won't go there but

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:10.360
there's no real limits the only limit I can really think of is what beyond like

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.000
hey your computer might crash is the file space limit that you have all

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.840
accounts start with a default storage space of one gigabyte beyond that you

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.280
will need to subscribe to our patreon to get more space and that will enable you

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:32.380
to save more I have currently have about 25 gigabytes of space based on my

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.340
account status and I'm using like 5% of that and I've been playing for three

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:41.360
years but I don't save everything I I don't know like recently like like half

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.600
a year ago or something I just stopped saving stuff that I like I don't I need

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.800
like it's cool but I don't need to save it I just remember where it is and then I go

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.680
there and spawn it out again or go find it if I need it that way I keep my file

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.600
space down and I have really really dense polygon meshes all sorts of stuff

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.840
I have a really really high high density chicken nugget which has an amazing

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.600
story about it

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.440
speedy baby another crate username here I like these these strange strange like

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.240
usernames ever ring to them they're good they ask what accessibility things are

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.760
in the game so it depends what type of accessibility you're talking about I'm

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.480
happy to go into specifics if you have a particular thing in mind that you're

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.120
you're concerned about ones that come to mind are the mute help which I mentioned

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.840
before that's for users who for whatever reason again no judgment from me don't

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.720
wish to speak they can use the mute helper to have that speech bubble appear

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.800
next to the messages that they type there are various versions of the

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.880
help there's even one that's sort of hooked up to text-to-speech so that the

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.880
message that you type will then be read in game using a text-to-speech voice and

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.560
text-to-speech is getting a great right now I know text-to-speech has a sort of

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.240
reputation in the older days of computing as being very robotic but I've

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:58.040
seen some text-to-speech on those avatars which is quite human beyond that

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:05.120
if you are colorblind I'm partially colorblind we do have a way to correct

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.440
for that it is a little bit experimental but there are filters that you can put

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.760
on your head that's sort of like a material you put on your head and they

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.680
can adjust the color spectrum of a world such that it might be a little bit

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.660
better you know we can make blues more blues or less blue whatever whatever you

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:23.800
need there if you are light sensitive I know that a couple of people like

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.400
sensitive we can also do the same thing as that colorblind filter but with a

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:30.000
darkening filter right it'll just take some of the intensity of the bright

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.120
lights out of the world I have some glasses in my inventory which I very

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.280
rarely equipped these days and I don't really know why I used to equip them all

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:45.840
the time in the early days moving beyond color if you are low vision there is the

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.160
ability to just arbitrarily create cameras in the world and I've seen a lot

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.960
of people who will I don't know where they are if anyone in chat is here and

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.480
there is where they are they've got sort of devices they parent to their avatar

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:59.320
that let them kind of zoom in on things a little bit like or similar to Windows

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:06.680
magnifier so I like seeing those we also have on that note we have disability

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.440
awareness badges which you can add to your account if someone below can link

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.080
the badges with the article we have a badge that says that you're colorblind

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.360
we have a badge that says that you are have vision issues we also have a badge

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:24.920
that says that you are deaf when it comes to the deaf community there we

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.860
have a lot of techniques and abilities that you can do in there we also have a

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:33.560
prominent few people that are in that community and are fantastic Danny comes

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.880
to mind Danny is fantastic they make just crazy stuff with the finger

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.880
tracking that we have and the leap motion support that we have we see a lot

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.840
of people that are able to sign a lot better inside Neos because they can just

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.520
sort of you know move their hands around we also have a couple of sort of hands

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.200
that are set up such that you can manually trigger letter fingerspelling

00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:02.220
signs in a sort of intuitive way we also have native subtitle support for videos

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:06.120
although I don't know how it works is on my list to make a tutorial about but I

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.040
was reading code earlier and I'm like oh yeah you can import subtitle files I

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.720
forgot how but you can and those can be hooked up beyond that though because I

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.960
could wear on for forever literally if there is a problem you might be able to

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:26.000
build something to fix that problem and people will love to help you like if you

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.440
go into a world and you say I am for whatever reason I am unable to

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.440
comprehend the existence of yellow like someone will quickly build you something

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.960
you can put on your head and it just removes yellow somehow so much he handed

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.960
me there yesterday when I was playing they handed me some glasses that gave

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:46.760
you the vision of a dog right so they remove the colors that dogs cannot see

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.440
and so if I looked at green grass for example it was actually yellow my color

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.960
blindness means that I can often not tell the difference between green and

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:58.120
yellow anyway so I was very confused I'm like this isn't any different and they're

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.440
like are you a dog no I'm not a dog I just can't tell the difference between

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:06.120
green and yellow sometimes moving forwards

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:10.440
Zillowsef has another question here which says what is the most difficult

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:15.040
thing that new players will have to deal with people have commented with emojis

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.320
to get logics and I would kind of agree but I would actually say is getting the

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:25.120
avatar imported the thing that like is is difficult about particularly people

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.400
that come from another platform that doesn't have the in editing ability is

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.320
you want to just get comfortable and I used to not understand this but after

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.840
like a month or two of playing VR I got it right people want to feel

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.920
comfortable in the avatar that they're wearing getting to that stage where

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.640
you're comfortable is going to be the most difficult part that's why you've

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.740
got an avatar that you're comfortable in it's moving correctly it looks

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:48.100
correct it's got your colors your textures on it and when you look in the

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.360
mirror you're like that's me once that's done that's probably the most difficult

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:55.440
hurdle and then beyond that it's up to you about what you want to do again like

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.060
I see people have said logics if you don't want to learn logics that's

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:01.560
totally fine you don't have to if you don't want to learn any of the engine

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.320
that's totally fine just get the avatar in ask for help and and you'll get it in

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.460
and then you can just socialize right so it just depends on which path or journey

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.660
that you want to go through on Neos. Slinkah says ET controller the one with

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:18.280
the driver already Neos yes the driver in Neos for ET controllers is like

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:23.040
really old it's from before they had six doff now they have a six doff version

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.120
which is the right image on the thumbnail from the link that Alex posted

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.880
it's got like a chunkier bit attached to it which is basically like a five

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.320
tracker but a neti version of that that's six doff six degrees of freedom

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.080
that means and that might mean there's an updated driver and if there's an

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.580
updated driver would have to edit that. Aaron says does Neos currently spot any

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.640
haptic gloves I believe we support the B haptics gloves those just give you

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.120
vibration feedback on the gloves they don't give you the haptics that I

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.880
believe you're talking about which is where you can like feel stuff in VR

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.560
speaking of feeling stuff does anyone remember the Novant Falcon if you

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.720
remember the Novant Falcon let me know there's any Novant Falcon remember is

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.520
let me know you don't know what it is you can go ahead and take a look at it

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:08.160
moving onwards Traderos hope I'm pronouncing that correctly another

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.520
interesting name is there currently any estimate of time frames when the key

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.480
updates would be applied or would there be some way to see updates on current

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.540
systems in the works although I generally do not like products and

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:21.160
services to be crushed the current state of the market is very competitive and

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.560
falling behind becomes problematic we are very aware of that there are lots of

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.680
things in progress here the announcements channel I don't want to

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.720
sort of dwell on that too much that our existing that are preventing us from

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.440
doing updates beyond that though I would encourage you to go look at our roadmap

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:38.800
on github if someone wants to drop the roadmap link in the in the chat that

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.960
would be great that shows you what we are working on or at least intending to

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:45.040
work on and also gives you our backlog which is large but it shows you that

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.480
we're thinking about stuff we want to feed back in each of those items as well

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.920
if there is a job issue that you found that you have and it's something to say

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.380
about comment on us let us know let us know how you feel let us know what you

00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:00.360
want to see in that future double stick says it's called dynamic bone no s by

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:05.020
will Hong that's the original thing yeah yeah I'd like to meet will Hong make you

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:09.320
say like hey how much like did you buy a house with about money you may I don't

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:15.340
know like yeah we have some love for EDF fantastic EDF is earth defense force is

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:18.840
a very crazy game and if you have a chance to play it please go ahead and do

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:24.280
and just like roll into the hilarity EDF is amazing egg roll face says I they

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.720
might have worded that probably because I was playing a hosting an instance I

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.000
would have to scroll up and find that question if you have a further up

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.120
question about hosting an instance do let me know spec says can you explain

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.880
for news is how to stop an avatar for face tracking so long as the blend ships

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.920
already exist yes when you create an avatar there's a bunch of check boxes on

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.560
the right hand on the like middle of the avatar credit just check them all I know

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.160
some of them are off by default I don't really know why just check them all

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.440
they're all useful one of them will automatically set up face tracking that

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.880
works at the HTC Vive face tracker I have one of those stuck to my face on my

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.420
headset and it makes me sometimes look really weird because my eyebrows do

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:04.140
wiggles but like that's fine for the face tracker itself it is based on the

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:08.120
blend shape definitions which we got from HTC in the tutorials channel of

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:12.780
this discord pinned is an image by gabell who made the sort of pivotal

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.560
example face tracking avatar which has all of those blend shapes set up you

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.160
don't have to name them exactly like that image if you have blend shapes that

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.300
are close enough then you could hook them up to the facial tracker I have a

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.320
video on that on my channel if someone could go ahead and make that that'd be

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:31.040
great as an example here many avatars have a smile blend shape and it's named

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.640
whatever it's named sometimes it's even named in Japanese you can hook that up

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:40.080
to the smile face tracker preset and it'll work even if it's not named

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:45.400
correctly and just that just having a smile adds so much more like emotion to

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:51.680
an avatar that you're wearing okay we're still my scroll bar is still huge let's

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.880
keep going I will answer all questions I know it's a little bit of a crazy day so

00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:00.040
I'll just keep going till we run out of questions no user found welcome to the

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:04.440
discord I see you a new from the plant icon like meant to be like a flower I

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:08.080
don't know it's a plant icon who asked how is the crypto stuff incorporated the

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.000
game and are certain avatars what locked behind NFTs or crypto nothing is locked

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.120
behind NFTs or crypto at all there might be some community products which you

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.520
have to buy using crypto but that's nothing to do with us that's the same

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.320
thing as buying an avatar off gumroad and then importing into nius we have no

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.120
worlds locked behind crypto or NFTs if you're asking about crypto being

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.640
integrated in the game the steam build has no crypto and functionality the non

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:37.080
steam build does in the non steam build you can deposit our currency and CR into

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:41.840
your in-game wallet and withdraw it you can send it to people and you can buy

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:47.360
storage with it that's it yeah moving on good questions today mr. Aaron Aaron's a

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:51.360
good friend of mine he says what are your opinions on the recent influx of

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:56.720
people and how it affect non-time news I am a bit puzzled about what might happen

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:02.080
long term for anyone here that's new I love having you here as just the rest of

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.640
our community we love helping you I just I don't know what's gonna happen in the

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:11.520
future like well VRC reverse their decision to add EAC if VRC does that how

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.600
many of you will stay I don't know and that's the bit like I'm unsure about I

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.880
would love it if all of you stay I understand the that might not be

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:23.160
realistic so if you choose not to stay that's totally fine thank you so much

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:28.080
for trying us and hope to see you back time some there sometime soon I'm

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:33.280
running out of English at the moment as to what I think about it is great it's

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.680
also unexpected I wish we'd had some notice it's a bit difficult for VRC to

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.600
basically be like yo we're dropping a big update you might get some users

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.460
because they're gonna hate it like that they wouldn't do that that's not like a

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:49.560
business thing that exists but it is unexpected like I had other plans for

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.480
this week but I guess they're kind of like thrown out let's go ahead and move

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.280
on see if any more questions is it there says I so I'm thinking this is the

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.600
official VRC killer no I disagree um the important thing to think about and we

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.800
encourage you to do this based on the guidelines channel of this discord is to

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.240
think about how think about the the metaverse platforms is like a family

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.620
right we should be getting along we should be talking to each other we

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.680
should be sharing insights I myself am friends with the head of trust and

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:22.160
safety at VR chat and I sent them some kind words yesterday I didn't like say

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.680
hey this is a bad decision or anything like that I just said hey good luck I

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.840
basically I read the update and I just said hey good luck you know let me know

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.280
if you need anything because like I know that they probably had a really really

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.040
tiresome day yesterday and that's the kind of dialogue that I want between

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.680
those platforms so it's I don't think it's appropriate to say one is better

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.480
than the other I think it's appropriate to say that they are different and that

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:47.920
they have different uses you'll see that sentiment a lot from people you also see

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:52.040
the opposite sentiment which is like no this is better than VRC no VRC is better

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:55.200
than this and like it's not my place to comment on that because I don't think we

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.480
should be coming on it a good way to think about it is how you think about

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.880
beverages food and stuff like that like the Pepsi Coca-Cola thing right you guys

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.800
have a preference we don't need to talk about it we'll start an argument but you

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.400
have a preference that's in your mind right now Pepsi or Coca-Cola but if

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:15.440
they're sold out of Pepsi or Coca-Cola in the grocery store you're gonna buy

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.440
the other one and you're gonna enjoy it so it's a matter of preference rather

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:25.960
than like a clear-cut distinction between the two platforms let's move on

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:29.680
llama with two L's hope I'm pronouncing that correctly welcome to the discord

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.000
is there any plan to add a reset password button to the web UI the

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.200
person's a little confusing you should converge the login to the website you

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.720
can't reset your password about being in game and I find a little clunky yes we

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.280
have like three websites it's problematic but we're doing our best

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:48.520
we're you know like I said we're working on stuff so we have the the main website

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.760
and that has all the information about it and then we have like the account

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.280
website and then we have a third account website which is what we're trying to

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.960
move everything over to I believe that actually has a reset part of

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:02.120
functionality on it it's just not like it doesn't really do anything other than

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.120
account right it's stuff so that might be an option to do that but we

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.920
absolutely have plans to sort of put that all together like a jigsaw puzzle

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:13.100
until it makes sense in the future Nash has updated their profile picture so I

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:15.560
can see their avatar a little better yeah that looks like it will work quite

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:23.080
well great let's move along egg roll fails again hope if you're fighting for

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.600
the EDF quite well anyway also is there someplace where there's a complete list

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:29.680
of desktop controls it seems the only one I can find is outdated wiki has it

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.240
the wiki shouldn't be out of date if it's out of date yell at me I'll update

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:36.480
it basic controls is the page on the Wikipedia on the not the Wikipedia the

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:41.640
Neos wiki moving forwards Aaron says what are some suggestions for getting VRC

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:46.080
users who may be on the fence or simply just trend follows to stay on these I

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.720
think we can do that based on the way that we handle the experience right so

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.040
if you come over to us to try us out thank you so much for trying us and if

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:59.240
you like it stay do make sure you give it a good try do make sure you come in

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.480
with attitude of like hey this might be a little bit difficult there are some

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:07.040
rough edges give it a try let us know what you think and if you don't decide

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:12.080
to stay that's fine thank you for trying moving on we've got delirious Jax's one

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.360
minute avatar I love that so delirious Jax's woman avatar is meant to be

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:20.880
slightly satirical and the reason why that is he has a perfect avatar set up

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.860
the textures import the IK is fine so you can just import that model and do

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:28.000
that and the reason why he's able to do that is because he knows what Neos needs

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.920
and he's able to craft an FBX file that works perfectly a lot of users this

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.920
might be the first time that you've even looked at the files inside your avatar

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:40.200
you might have been doing solely with like download drops of unity packages

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:44.760
from avatar creators and that's totally fine like if you are a knowledgeable

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:50.760
user like Jax there should be able to just make an FBX that works I had that

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:55.600
actually yesterday with null user they brought the avatar in and the like rig

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:59.480
was just messed up and I explained what was wrong and I apologize that you know

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.880
there was no way to fix it in game and they went oh it's okay I can fix in

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.000
blender they took off their headset crumpled into a heap on the floor came

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.960
back five minutes later with a working file and it was beautiful I'm like my

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.800
job is done baby they understood my statement and they did it

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.200
Zillow says says what is the history of Neos had it will start I'm gonna bridge

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.160
this some people might have some links if you've got some links to better

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.200
histories of that but I'm gonna bridge it because I don't want to go on too

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:28.760
long Fruxius is an original backer of the original oculus rift and when they

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:33.040
got the oculus rift they went to a lot of like meetups like you know hacker

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:38.560
meetups stuff like that jams stuff like that and they created a bunch of cool

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:41.440
stuff and they noticed that they were doing the same thing over and over again

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.560
when you start a new VR project what's the first thing you do you make hands

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:49.160
the hands work and then maybe once you've got hands you do grabbing like

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.920
think about all the VR games you have they all have hands and grabbing and you

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:57.040
might have to grab a gun or a ball or an object and he was getting tired of

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.420
repeatedly doing that he's like I've just started a new project I've got a

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.260
copy this code from the other project that sets up hands into this new project

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.680
that sets up hands and so originally he was like what if I made the project

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:11.960
project which was Neos and it's like cool now I can make my other projects in

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:16.620
Neos and then it was like well now I can have multiplayer and this collaboration

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:20.640
and people could join and talk to me and it's like well now we have avatars and

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:24.800
then slowly it sort of evolved into a social metaverse but with that also

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:29.640
creation around as a metaverse that's how it all got started specs has a good

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:33.980
point there which is the first time that they imported a VRC avatar they found it

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:37.760
tedious I agree I was completely confused I'd not done unity much before

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.200
so I was just like what are all these buttons as well as for Neos they say but

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:46.920
now if he had to choose he would start with Neos because it's simpler and I

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.520
agree that's the thing as well if the roles were reversed if you were coming

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:55.560
over to me and I was representative of VR chat and you just you know hopped over

00:58:55.560 --> 00:59:00.240
from Neos and I'm like hi welcome to VRC to set up an avatar you need to do the

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.720
process that you do for VRC avatar set up you might have the same feedback you

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.720
might have the same feedback this is tedious this is confusing and that's

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.840
again all about the attitude if you come over naturally if it's confusing you're

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.960
gonna have a bad time if you come in the attitude of I'm going to try this I

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:16.760
might get confused I'm gonna ask for help then you'll have a much better

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.960
time so Akki Adachi says when will we get the an option to stay logged in

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:24.520
forever that is a colon problem that we have we're only able to remember your

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:29.120
login for seven days due to security and that what that means is if you log in

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:33.240
we'll remember you for seven days and that's like a rolling window so if I

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:38.480
log in today it will remember me till next Tuesday if I log in on Wednesday or

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:41.320
remember you need to next Wednesday so if I continue to log in each day I'll

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.520
never have to I'll never have to enter my password again and as I use Neos a

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.400
lot I never really have to but we're unable to remember you for forever

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:53.480
because of our security policies we may change that in the future but it just

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:58.880
requires us to sort of evaluate the security problems with that and and

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.040
adjust them moving forwards Alex's is there a patreon in fact yes you can

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.840
technically make a world which is only accessible to patrons I have no idea if

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.520
anyone's done that or why you might do that Lexis that there should be a hard

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.260
limit yeah okay we'll sit a hard limit we'll say a hard limit for for quarter

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.920
past I would say ten past but we're already like four minutes quarter past

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.680
we'll say a hard limit for quarter past you're right I do have other stuff to do

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.680
today um Zilla says is the game enjoyable without getting any

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.920
subscription yes provided you only upload your avatar and you are wary on

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:34.640
what you save absolutely absolutely don't be a pack rat nowhere stuff is

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.760
rather than than saving it as well so if you have a public folder full of cool

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.040
stuff that someone else has saved cool that won't count to your storage space

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.920
and you can just spawn it if you want to just chill out and and see yourself more

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:52.080
as sort of like a chill out not the platform just a person who chills out on

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.000
social VR then all you need is your avatar uploaded you can do everything

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.600
that you've ever done on VR chat without a subscription for sure if you want to

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.720
build stuff you will maybe at some point run into that up where there's a you

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.760
know hey you're out of storage space but if you're careful there's a lot that you

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.560
can do about running out of storage space Zilla says so wait is all the

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.760
storage in the cloud yes all storage is in the cloud for the most part there is

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:20.920
a caveat to that which is not used a lot when you open Neos you'll see that two

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.440
worlds opened you can close these there's ways to do it I'm going to that

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.320
by default two worlds opened there is the local home and the cloud home

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.840
anything saved to the local home as in saved inside the local home you drop it

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.280
in there you hit save will be saved on your computer it doesn't touch the cloud

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.680
anything saved anywhere else including your imagery will be saved to the cloud

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:46.000
it is also sort of slightly higgledy-piggledy magic saved to your

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.240
computer that's just a local cache of it a local database of it and a local copy

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.800
of it but it is saved to the cloud as well I'm forgetting all the way down to

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.720
all the links I requested thank you froppy for linking badges thanks June for

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:10.720
linking that mod for the zooming in beautiful by the way yo we do support

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:17.760
odds we have a modding policy and the modding community are upholding that

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.560
policy to a better level than I believe even I can like they are basically like

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.680
guys if you're being malicious with your mods get out of here like they won't

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.240
help you and all sorts of stuff like that I really do like them

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.880
well it's don't break the guidelines read that modern plug-in policy also

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.200
read our security policy because it's very important that you read all the

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.520
policies we have I wrote the part of the modern plug-in policy I also wrote this

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.520
is the security policy so just I'm kind of proud of them anyway moving on

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.200
zilla says now is there a roadmap for this yes you can find a roadmap on

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:54.120
github someone can link it froppy did thank you no user found says they don't

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.360
worry about force crypto NFT why the crypto stock prices and telegram and

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:03.880
also the nearest metaverse website read announcements moving onwards okay no

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:12.640
more questions specs links an issue great lego creator is asking about low

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.840
vision stuff if anyone has any low vision assets please do help lego

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:21.240
creator out I know of some but I don't know where they are located so please

please do help them out I don't want to like call anyone out and be like oh yes

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.120
I remember this user hello vision but I will direct message a user I'm aware of

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.880
and ask for their permission to connect you two together because I know that

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.520
they have a lot of tools on their avatar and I'm sure if I ask them politely

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:43.200
enough they'll be happy to show to show you how they got set up so they feel

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.600
sorry for asking so don't worry about it if it was a problem if I needed to go

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.440
if my house is on fire I would I would I would quit it I would just get rid of it

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:55.280
okay I'm not seeing questions I'm seeing a lot of responses to questions that's

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.520
fine see a lot of links to videos face tracker setups excellent videos great

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:04.840
Quincy says speaking of which can people make shops or on the earth to sell

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:09.560
avatars and worlds yes absolutely we actually had I forget I'm so sorry I

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.400
forget which furry convention it was but they had the equivalent of the the

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.800
dealers den or the like the show floor area as a world and you could go in

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.380
there and each person had like a market stall with a hyperlink that could be

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:24.560
on there and that allowed them basically say like hey here's a sample of my

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.920
artwork click here it'll take you to their their Commission page stuff like

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.600
that you could also do if you set up commissions correctly you could also do

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.600
a few demo worlds to demo avatars that wouldn't be like entirely secure like

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.520
you know cuz you're still risking it by giving them the avatar to to where but

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:46.580
you won't be able to save it you could do that you can also use Neos on your

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.940
like gumroad pages or whatever to be like hey look here's a video of my

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:56.060
avatar in Neos look how expressive it is look at how you know the face tracker

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.720
works the dynamic bones work you know that's fine how did I end up scrolling

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:04.380
up I don't particularly know I just like read another question I'm like what

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:13.320
llama kelex bit kyun thank you for letting us know let's try and keep VRC

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:19.560
discussion about that breaking news not here or be here forever it is not a

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:24.960
time to talk about EAC or VRC in this particular I mean VLC a little bit but

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.240
not easy basic controls has been linked fantastic

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.400
Nash had issues loading their homework last night is that fixed now I'm sorry I

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.720
don't know what your homework is I understand that's a nice normal typo so

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.680
yes it should be better if you still see issues do let us know we're still keeping

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.080
an eye on and based on why I just read we might have to like push a few more

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:53.080
buttons okay moving forwards kip says word from the wise organize your stuff

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.280
in folders you will enjoy agreed there is actually a video on my channel about

01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:00.580
how I organize stuff in folders coffee has added coffee kai sorry there's a lot

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:03.960
of coffee so I have to be specific coffee kai has asked as added a link to

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:08.400
the Neos modding discord go there if you'd like the one ask I have and I'm

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.800
sure the Neos modding community won't be offended by this is do check Neos's

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:18.160
features before you start modding there are a lot of mods that you you think you

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:22.840
might need because you're coming from a different platform that you don't need

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:28.680
good example there being like grabbing other people's bones before the fist

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:33.880
bone update I knew that that was a mod that was in play in VR chat you don't

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.360
need that over here so you wouldn't need to mock that so do just take a look at

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.160
Neos's features before you then get all sort of embroidered in the modding

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.880
community there are a lot of cool mods there but you might not need any is what

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.600
I'm saying just like keep in mind what you might need race is one another team

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.720
member in the stage of you um we're good for now maybe another time hey wraith

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.280
you could do your own officers if you want nothing stopping you you could do a

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.520
UK time one as well that might be better for Europe

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.060
dresen said that is for ality yes that was a for a further like oh no

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:09.400
funnel equinox kip says um I get the names of them confused if you are a furry

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:14.080
convention creator consider not putting fur in the name of your convention I

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.200
know it's like a really easy way to signal to the community hey this is a

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.840
furry convention but like for Prime's brain it just is like they all get

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:25.280
bundled into one and I get confused I apologize for that I should be better at

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.280
that scrolling through stifle has linked how to organize my

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.160
venturi thank you for that that was a Christmas tutorial I've got that sent

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.520

you are the last two questions no other questions will be accepted thank you so

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.280
much for allowing us to get through this there will be a recording of this on the

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.200
on the sounder I use sounder because it's got like transcription the

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.680
transcriptions kind of bad but I'll actually click around and and navigate

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:02.880
through the audio quite quickly that people like I'm still waiting for them

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.480
to update their transcription editor so that I can actually edit this

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:09.320
transcriptions to be even more accurate so thank you all if you have any other

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:13.160
