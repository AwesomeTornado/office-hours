00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hello everyone, welcome to office hours for the 8th of the 11th, 2022. Is it the 8th already? Damn it. Okay.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So we're going to get started with some questions that we've already got. Please put questions in the thread that's been created and I'll get to them as soon as I can.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Sorry for the sniffles today. It appears I have a cold.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So Specs ask, while I know Neos updates are on hold, I'm curious if you or someone else on the team has investigated the Quest Pro's face and eye-tracking implementations.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Do they seem to differ significantly from vibes? No one has looked at that to my knowledge, although Geens owns one, so maybe they'll tinker around and take a look.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Ozzy has a question here which says, it's like a question that they asked yesterday in questions, but despite trying to test it with Headless, I could not figure out how World Path works properly.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Can you go into more detail about it if possible? Namely how to use it with Headless.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:10.000
No, because I don't know. I'd have to dig it up and make sure I get documentation on it, but like Lex said, records, which is actually what we call worlds, avatars, models, gadgets, whatever it is that you save to your inventory, it's called a record, and worlds are also records.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000
They have a path, and if you know that path, you can use it in various ways, so World Path lets you sort of overwrite the path of that world, and you can pick that up.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's a little bit like the custom session ID property that you can do, where you can have a static session ID using custom session ID.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Those are really cool for actually the MMC voting world. I have a Headless server where I just start it up, and because that custom session ID never changes, all the gadgets and stuff I've made to link to that world still work.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I will make a note to dig into that one, but I'm not going to stumble through it today. I've just written it down on my notepad in about size 80 font, because I couldn't reach my notepad, and I don't really care how big I read it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There we go, I can read that. Cool. Moving forwards.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Iregubus says, why spawning a camera makes my FPS drop a lot?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Yeah, that's just because the camera is rendering. If you're not looking at the camera, then again, it's probably because the camera is still rendering.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It shouldn't be that impactful.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
When you say drops a lot, do you mean like a few? 5, 10, 20?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It will drop a bit, though, because it's like re-rendering the scene for that camera.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Particularly if it's like a 4K camera. I've seen a lot of people doing that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You know the mirrors with the customizable resolution? Those have got like 8K on them, and I've seen people that set them to 8K and then complain about their FPS, and it's just like, well, you have an 8K mirror, so maybe drop it to 4K, you probably won't notice the difference.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Yeah, it might render twice, I'm not sure.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:05.000
A good actual test would be trying a portal as well. So if you do create new object portal, a portal is like a stereoscopic camera, so see what your FPS goes to with that.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:16.000
By stereoscopic, we mean different view for each eye, by the way, sorry, like scientific words, sometimes good, sometimes bad, so I'll clarify them.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Random fact of the day, the smallest camera resolution you can go to is 4x4. No, wait, 2x2, it might be 4x4 or 2x2, I don't know anymore.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I did know, and then I started talking, and now I don't.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
That's it for questions, I see people typing, until people paste their questions.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The color sampler node, that does the smallest resolution camera that is possible. I double checked the code on that before I put out the sample color tutorial.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
That sample color tutorial was, I don't know why these things come in waves, but it seems like when I recorded that, like everyone was asking about it,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and I was just getting barraged at questions where people were like, it doesn't work on videos.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm not sure it does, it doesn't work on skyboxes, pretty sure it does.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
That's why that video is basically just like every object type sample color works.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I haven't opened the code base today, but I should, so I'm going to go ahead and open it.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Zach asks, will you spook by someone being in your world that you made private while you're making a presentation?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
No, no, there's a difference in my head at least, with making a presentation or delivering a presentation.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So yes, I am working a presentation for Friday, it should actually be up on YouTube as well,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
there'll be a three minute presentation on some projects we're doing at an event.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The event is public, but I would link it, but it's basically going to be six minutes of Neos.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We've got two projects that are using Neos, and then three to four to five hours of stuff that doesn't involve Neos,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and is mostly about sort of opening up people's faces and putting in metal plates and stuff, it's really gross.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So cool, but I'll put the videos up when I can get them up.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The other project I'll have to get permission for, but my presentation is my presentation, I'll just put it on YouTube.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
The general rule of thumb for my worlds is if it's open, it's meant to be open,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and if you come in and it wasn't actually meant to be open, that's my fault, that's not your fault, that's my fault.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I might still ask you politely to leave, but I should never be mad at you.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's the equivalent of people leaving their blinds open and then complaining that people are looking through their windows.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I understand if I'm camped out in front of someone's house with binoculars or something,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
but if I'm just walking past, right, I should fight.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Let's move forward.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Arugaba says, how do I move objects around my inventory? You can't.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I just posted a weird and complicated way of doing it, but you can't natively right now.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Now, whenever I see people complaining about that, whilst I do understand, and I do emphasise,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
if you, when you're watching YouTube videos inside Neos doing absolutely nothing,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
if you manually move one item a day, then in ten days you'll have moved ten items to their correct location,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and in a hundred days you'll have moved a hundred items.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So you can move them, it's just really complicated right now.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
You have to spawn the item, go to the place where you'd like it to be, resave the item to that folder,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
go back to the original location once your sink has been synced, and then delete it from your location.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I have a video on my channel about how I organise my inventory,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and I've seen being very rigid and strict on that has worked,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
such that I don't really have many issues,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
but I do have dump locations such as the root of the inventory and a temp folder.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I recommend a temp folder because that means that the root of your inventory isn't fooled with stuff,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and it means that you can just go into that temp folder whenever you need to just quickly save something,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
go into that temp folder.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Moving forward, Zach says, someone claims they spooked you because their booper made a sound,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and you turn it around extremely fast. That happens all the time.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Generically, if you have sounds on your avatar, I hate them because they're always done wrong.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Not always, like I'm not saying for you particularly, I'm saying for the collective you,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and the entire community, it's like I have a booper, it makes a noise in the global audio space at 500,000 volume,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and yeah, I'm going to be startled by that.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Make sure you're using appropriately volumed and distanced audio on your voice.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Thank you.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Nigabah says, does voice messages count in the storage space? Yes, they can in your storage space.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Additionally, if you're having sync issues, voice messages might get stuck as well.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So I do recommend voice messages because they're cool, but kind of don't at the same time

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
because there's no way to sort of delete them after the fact, so they can build up.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Yeah, root of the inventory is just make a temp folder, right, make a temp folder,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and that way when you know that you want to go take a look at your shame and your mess,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
you can go into the temp folder, but otherwise you have a clean root inventory.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Just do it right now if you're in the US. Open up your inventory, make a folder called TMP,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
whatever you want to call it, just that's where you save stuff where you don't know where it goes.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Theo asks, so they're clear with their Quake 3 spawn sounds.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
If they're local, reasonably volumed, and yeah, sure, oh, yes.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Rigobus has another question, which is, is it safe to delete the entire Neos cache folder after it gets too big? Yes.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
But ensure that you are deleting the cache and not the local database.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
You can clear the local database, but that has different implications for clearing the cache.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
There are two folders. You can find out more about them at a lovely Wiki article,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
which a certain someone wrote. I don't know if you know their name.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Probably. Yeah, that linked for you. Yeah.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So you want to be deleting the cache and not the database. You can delete the database, of course,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
if you would like to, but do follow the guide there because I'd rather you didn't, basically.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
But I know that some people need to occasionally. I answered the Quake one. Let's move forwards.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Zari says, I have some tidbits of the awesome Edu stuff you've worked on.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Is a lot of that private to the institution or is there someplace to explore those?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Some of it's private for like patient privacy reasons.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Some of it's private from like busyness and some of it's private from laziness.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So it's sort of a mix there. I am trying to be like exceptionally public

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
about the jaw reconstruction stuff I'm doing because there's no real reason to hide it.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Particularly now I've replaced all the patient data with just 3D artist stuff.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So we'll see. Like I said, the talk I'm giving on it on Friday, I should be able to make public.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So I'll just shove that on YouTube when I can. I'm going to scroll back through my pictures

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and find a very particular picture. Yes, here you go.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Welcome to jaw land.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Additionally, because there's something like cute about it,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
I'm going to link this video for you guys as well.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So I'm doing this presentation on Friday at an event.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And I wanted to make a slide deck. And so I made a slide deck that was boring

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and then I brought it into Neos and added visual assets for it.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So at this point in the video that I just linked, my headset's on the floor.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I'm done practicing for a while, but for some reason I'm still recording because

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I don't know, I'm recording the clip. Yeah, that makes sense.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So I'm not even paying attention to what's going on on my screen.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I think I was making tea at the time or something.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
But I came back and I just watched these two animated individuals just play.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Because whilst I'm talking about the slide that's on view there, they're just doing their stuff.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
There's a camera anchor that's green in the middle there, which will be where the camera is during it.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And it's just like, I don't know. I was mesmerized by how cool it was.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Yeah, the little people in my computer.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000
We're really trying to sell the difference in the educational sector from 360 degree videos,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
which lots of people in the sector call VR and actual VR, where there is space

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that you can move through and interact with.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And so lots of my slides for that presentation have animated stuff on them.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.000
That one is just like tip top. That one, I had the idea really late at night.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I'm going to do it. Tony says,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Not a question, but I had to clear my local DBs since downloads were extremely slow after clearing it.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Stuff was downloading at full speed. Yeah, I don't even know what's up with that one.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We've got to look into that more. There is a bit of a show about that one.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
That's really weird. That's why I say if you want to clear your database, knock yourself out.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
But don't continually do it. I've seen people that clear it every day because they think

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that's just how you keep Neos working. And the answer is no.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
That's a really bad way to keep Neos working.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:14.000
That's the equivalent of cleaning your oven out or your chimneys or your sink

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
or the toilet cleaning that every day. It's just weird. Don't do it.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Like a full deep clean. I know that there's some people, myself included,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that will give it a wipe around every day.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000
But you get out the frothy, super duper ultra bleach cleaner and drain the sink and that.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
No. We actually have a few TV shows in the UK which followed around Clean Freaks.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I can't remember what it was called, but they basically took Clean Freaks and then put them into dirty houses.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
There was one episode where they took them all to this big manor house that just wasn't that clean.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
They freaked out over the smallest thing. The chandelier had cobwebs on it.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I remember this lady screaming and running out the room because there were cobwebs on the chandelier.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Also, what's the difference between a spider web in your house and a cobweb? I don't know.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
On the top of my head, a cobweb is when dust has settled on the web.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So it's not really a functional web for the spider anymore. It's just dust and spider web.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000
These clean people bleach the toilet every day, vacuum every day.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I think there was one that steamed the curtains every day.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We have actual nearest questions rather than talking about cleaning houses all day. Excellent.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Easton asks what do you think about AI writing? I've been playing around with the opening to Playground.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's really impressive. I had it write multiple SpongeBob episodes. Interesting.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I get a little bogged down by AI, to be honest.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
There's usually a channel on a lot of Discords that I'm in where they just post AI art.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And I mute those and try and get no notifications from those.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Or if the server doesn't have a dedicated AI art channel, I ask them to make one.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Because it can resemble the same problem as like TikTok or YouTube Shorts

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
where it's just like an endless supply of stuff.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And at a certain point, you're just looking at it to look at it, not looking at it for any purpose.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So it's just like, it's weird. It is cool. I'm sure I would use it in some cases.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
But I don't like playing with it. There needs to be a use for it.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I know you're talking mostly about AI writing. So again, there has to be a use for it.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I'm not going to go play with it just for the sake of playing.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Am I going there to generate images I need for inspiration? That's a use.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Am I going there for inspiration for actual writing? Yes.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Am I going there because I'm making an open world survival game akin to Skyrim

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and I need a bunch of books to place within the world?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
That's a perfectly good reason for AI writing, as far as I'm aware.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
But am I going there to do a bunch of AI writing because I don't want to do my dishes,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
vacuum my floor, clean my sink or go to bed? Then that's a problem.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I'm trying to reduce the amount of times where that occurs.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Otherwise, you know, you're watching YouTube Shorts for like three hours in bed

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and you're just like, I don't know what time, date or planet I'm on right now,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
but I should really sleep. I think it was Fur.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Yeah, Fur was saying to me yesterday that they installed a third party YouTube app

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
on their phone, which still works with regular YouTube, just so that Shorts weren't on their phone.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Probably going to do that. A friend back in my university days,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
they bought an ancient, it wasn't ancient, I think it was brand new,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
but they bought a wind-up alarm clock.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And the reason they bought the alarm clock is because they were just tired of using a phone.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
They're like, it's just not working. You know, it goes wrong. It's not charged.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
There's apps on there I don't want. When I sleep, I just want an alarm clock that rings

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and that's all it does. So they bought a mechanical alarm clock.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And it worked really well, except for if they forgot to wind it.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Thank you, Scary. That's actually really good to know.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I'm going to install one of those, yeah.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I uninstalled a bunch of apps that shouldn't be on my phone anyway.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Let's be honest, right? Most phone apps are just for wasting time.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Oh, we have a question I missed. I'm so sorry.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Yeah, I totally missed that one. I was just about to ask if there's any more questions.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
How do I save world orbs? The option is always grayed out even on public worlds.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And I can only create a session orb, but wouldn't a session orb just link to a session?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Yes, it would. And then you have your answer there, which is you have to select new session

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
in the expanded world view, and then you can get a world orb there and save it.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I will now paranoidly scroll for more questions just in case I've missed them by talking about

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
mobile phones and cobwebs for too long. Ah, Tiki has a good question.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So is there a way to put a foot-like collider so, for example, the tail collides at the ground?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
You're going to hate this one. For that you need a dynamic bone collider,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
which can only be spheres right now, in the ground, which is parented to your avatar,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
which is incredibly big. And then you'll have a floor collider for your dynamic bone.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
That's how you do it. I'm going to draw a crappy paint image for you right now.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I don't have any of this running, but I feel like doing it, so I'm going to do it.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
It's going to be amazing. Oh yeah, they've got a really long body by mistake.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Alright, here you go. Here's how you set it up.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So, you put that giant sphere collider, but parented to you,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:45.000
and you make it really, really big, and then the tail will be unable to go through the ground.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I hope you enjoyed Prime's artwork.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Yeah, big huge ball that you carry around with you.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I'll try not to make many innuendos about the big balls dangling behind you.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
There's another question, which says,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
since Neos uses some kind of Unity, is it compiled of IL2CPP?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I don't know much about the Unity side of things, actually.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
I just don't need to go there a lot, and it's kind of scary to go there,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
because it's a little bit of a mess down there right now.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
The Froox Engine side of things is just a compiled DLL.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
We do a bunch of post-processing on that DLL to make it even more efficient.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
That does work with the IL, so just make it more efficient.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I haven't looked into that as well, because that's kind of scary.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
But, once it goes over to Unity, it's a regular Unity project.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
On the very rare occasion where I compile the Unity project,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I get the made-by-Unity splash screen before I get Neo's splash screen,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
because I'm using a version of Unity that doesn't have a pro license or whatever.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So it's just like, made-by-Unity, and then giant Neos logo.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
But it's like, OK, cool.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Forgot where I was for a moment.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
So we're closing in on half an hour,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
so if you have any additional questions, please go get them typed up,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
and I'll get them answered in the order that they appear.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Merogverse has another question,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
which is it possible to load a C Sharp script

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
or some other programming language that is in text form?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
No. Well, sort of.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
It's a long question, depending on what you want to do, really.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
So the ultimate way of doing C Sharp would be to write a plug-in.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
That would give you infinite freedom to do whatever you want.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
If you want to hook up Neos with logics to a firework machine,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
you can totally do that.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Someone will probably enter the world and immediately crash it

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
and, like, shoot off all your fireworks,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
but you could do it if you wanted to.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Below that is then, of course, mods,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
which is where you are modifying the existing game.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
That has limitations whereby you'll probably crash the game

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
more than you realize if you're writing mods,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
particularly if you're in multiplayer sessions.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And then beneath that is logics,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
which, of course, you know our language,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
but that's not text-based.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And then beneath that is there's a couple of worlds

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
which have text-based languages that people have created.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Those are usually limited in what they can do

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
and probably wouldn't be suitable for generic programming.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
They are suitable for sort of playing around and experimenting,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
but they can do things like create cubes, create shapes,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
mathematical shapes or otherwise, et cetera.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
They're really cool.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
In the future, on our roadmap,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000
we want to look into taking a look at something called WebAssembly,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
where you can kind of just write any language

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
and compile it in a way that will work with Neos.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
We don't know what that will look like.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
It is on the roadmap.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Moonbase has a question here.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
They say, how does one do color dialogues?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Let's say changing material color in your avatar.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
What's the best way to do that?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Unfortunately, right now,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
the best way to do color dialogues

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
is either to copy the inspector's components.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
You can do that.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
All you need is a UIX canvas,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
and then you can make a button

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
that will trigger a color dialogue and work correctly.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
That is a little bit complicated.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
So what some people do is they'll parent

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
a invisible color dialogue to their avatar, to their tool,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
and then when it's needed,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
they will summon it to a correct position,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
turn on its active checkbox, and then you can edit it.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
That is okay.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
If you do do that, though,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
consider just having one of them

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
and then redirecting where it's driving its color to,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
rather than having multiple.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
If you have set colors,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
then set colors can also be done without the color dialogue.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
I should probably do a tutorial at some point

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
on how you can basically inspect an inspector

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
to figure out how to make UI in UIX.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
It's kind of cool.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
It's like, oh, on my personal customized piece of UIX,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I need a number input box.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
How do I do that?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Well, if you inspect the inspector,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
you can find out how the inspector

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
does a number input box.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Lex asks, are you able to modify

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
currently as functionality of plugins

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
in case you want to, for example,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
add values to enums or add functionality to a class?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Adding functionality to a class should be easy

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
by either using partial classes,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
extending it or something like that should be easy.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
That would really be like a C sharp question, though.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
How do you add stuff to an existing class?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Partial class might work.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Extending to a new class might work.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Of course, you have the opportunity

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
to overwrite our bootstrapper.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
At that point, you can do whatever the hell you want.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
I understand that might be tricky,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
because you might say like,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
hey, no, I want this method to do something different.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
You might be able to overwrite it.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
It's a little bit tricky, isn't it?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Moving forward, Scant says,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
does Neos prefer a large message,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
a few large messages or mesh messages?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Does Neos prefer a few large mesh meshes

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
or far more smaller ones?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
I noticed that a specific world I was uploading

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
would only save with the former.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Not saving probably has nothing to do

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
with the size of your meshes.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
I would say smaller ones currently,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
but I don't have any scientific basis

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
to back that up currently.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Specs says you can create an application

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
running a web server and interact with it

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
using WebSockets.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
That would keep Neos vanilla.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
I believe that's in reference to plugins,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
mods, and stuff like that.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
That would work, but please, for the love of God,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
consider the HTTP notes.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
So many people just always use WebSockets.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And I'm like, that has additional overhead, you know?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
If you're doing request response style data,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
just use HTTP. It's much better.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Everyone's like, but a WebSocket server!

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And I'm like, just use HTTP notes.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
It's how the rest of the world works.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
The rest of the world only opens up a WebSocket channel

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
when they need bidirectional data flow.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Moving forward to Irigibus has another question.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
I saw someone with a UI searching public objects in Neos.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
That is RedX.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
It could also be GilFX's original one,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
which you can find in GilFX's public folder.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
I use the GilFX's one because I can't find RedX

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
either.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I dislike the situation that we have in Neos for it.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
It's like, if you don't know where something is,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
you can't find it.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I know that's obvious and follows logically,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
but it's annoying.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And the whole, like, ask someone that's already got it,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I also find that annoying.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
But in this case, it is correct.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
If you don't have RedX, just ask someone for it.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
It'll probably be in one of those new user folders

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
as well, which should make it a little bit easier to find.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Oh, yeah.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Easton's got a link for you.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Yeah, bidirectional repeated data.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And so it's like an event flow, right?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
So a good example which might be easy to figure out

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
is, let's say you have two applications.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
So you have a chat application, which is for chatting,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
and then you have an application which is

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
to get the weather in my city.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Let's run a test here.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
So for the chat application, should we

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
use WebSockets or HDP nodes?

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
I'll give you guys some time to think and maybe type.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
We're having, like, a live Q&amp;A with chat.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
All right, that's enough time.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
So for chat, we should use WebSockets

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
because we need bidirectional data flow

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
and we need surprise data, right?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Someone needs to be able to send a chat message

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
and the person needs to receive that message.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
To get the weather in my city, though,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
we don't need a bidirectional data flow.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
We need a request response data flow.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
It's known as HDP nodes.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Get me the weather in my city.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Here is the weather in your city.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Done.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Connection closed.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
OK, moving forwards to additional questions.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
So we can move on here.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
That's done, that's done, that's done.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
That's done.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Who else?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
How do I buy more storage space?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
So you can buy it with Patreon by subscribing to our Patreon.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
That will only kick in at the start of the month.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
So you've unfortunately just missed the start of November.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
So you'll have to wait until December for Patreon storage

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
to kick in.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Or you can use NCR to rent more storage using,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
you'll have to use the standalone build to do that.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I believe the price is a little weird right now,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
but it gets you storage automatically.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
There's also a bunch of Neos users who will just give you

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
storage space for a while because they have NCR

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
and they don't really know what to do with it.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
There you go.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Lex says I'm kind of using WebSockets to continuously get

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
messages from our YouTube live chat.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Yep.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Perfectly fine use for WebSockets.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
I love how I'm just going to grab this image of Delta's

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Avatar and I'm going to grab my artwork and just put them

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
in the same message.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
It's just beautiful.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
You know, it's like that meme where it's like how to draw

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
an owl or it's like draw two circles and then draw the

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
rest of the owl.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
With that, I believe, though, we're out of questions.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
I will give the spec some time to see if they're already

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
typing.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
If there ever is, we'll stop questions.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
All right.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
We've got the last question, if that's a question.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
We'll move on with the rest of today.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
I hope my dishwasher finishes soon.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
I want to cook dinner.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Is it possible to construct meshes dynamically with

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Logix?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Last question.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
No more questions, but yes and no.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Depends what you want.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
There are 3D printers that exist inside of Neos.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
What they do is they use a pen tip and Logix to move a

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
pen tip around and just draw the pen.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
They're really quite good, but they act like 3D printers,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
so you get all the internalized geometry.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
So if you do a square on the 3D printer, sorry, a cube,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
got to be three dimensional here, then it won't be like

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
the cube that you can create from the create menu where

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
there's no internals.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
It'll be a cube with like goop in the middle coming all

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
the way up.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
If you want to do not that, the triangle procedural

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
meshes is for you.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Aegis has just posted there in their public folder,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
which I believe is in Neos Essentials somewhere.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
They have a mesh editor that uses the triangle procedural

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
mesh, which is really good.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And then beyond that, if you want procedural,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Neos Plus, which Linker has just posted there, has

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
dynamic mesh nodes, but it is a plugin.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
However, once you've finished with your dynamic mesh,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
if you bake it, it will turn into a static mesh and then

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
you'll be able to take it back to the non-plugin version

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
of Neos.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Additionally, there is a world in MMC 2022 where they

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
allow you to enter a mathematical equation and then

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
it outputs a mesh.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
That's really cool.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Lots of sort of shapes that you can see in nature and

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
things like that are generated from mathematics,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
and so you can do that.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Like if you put in the correct mathematical equation,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
for example, you'll get a snail shell or like a close

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
approximation to it.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
With that, I'll go ahead and leave off questions and

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
this session, and I will speak to you guys soon.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
If you have additional questions, ping me, DM me,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
questions and help, and read the wiki and use web

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
sockets for bi-directional communication only.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Goodbye.
