00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
 It is the top of the hour so go ahead and get started. Welcome to Office Hours, the half hour segment where I answer your questions about Nias.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.200
 Please drop your questions in the Office Hours text chat and I'll get to them in the order that they appear.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.080
 If you don't know why you're here or you're hearing a voice and you don't know why it's because you clicked an announcement that appeared and you've now joined the Office Hours meeting stage.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.160
 Please stay, ask questions about Nias, I'll answer them in the order that they appear.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.360
 We have a question. Ray! Lex asks

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.880
 What do you think would be a good world permission setup and access level be for users who, for someone who wants to create something

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.760
 but doesn't mind visitors watching but also gets distracted easily?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.720
 I've been thinking about this a lot and like

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.560
 I built a few things as well when I was trying to do it a while ago.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.640
 Think about limiting

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.360
 limiting stuff by both the permission system. So the permission system by just setting them to spectator

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.320
 they won't be able to spawn anything. Loads of people will literally lose their minds if they can't spawn stuff.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.320
 That's more sort of function of them than you though, because if you've ever played other VR platforms

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.880
 you can't spawn stuff in those platforms. So just sit still and don't squirm about that one.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.760
 The next level you can do is some form of like notification when they join the world like hey, I'm building like don't distract me.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.600
 But I've also been experimenting with like red velvet ropes if that makes sense.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.000
 I didn't do it in that way. I think I did it with like just like a like a sphere or a cylinder mesh.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.200
 Where it's like hey, don't like don't cross this line, right? I made it so like they were still with an earshot.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.800
 They could still talk to me, but it's like don't like don't get up in my space, you know.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.920
 But more than like personal space where you know, they're like, you know in your personal space. It's more like workshop space.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.600
 Almost felt like a museum. That wasn't that effective, but it did prevent the amazing problem.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.400
 Which is people who like to enter this thing that you're building go right inside it. Their entire

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.560
 avatar, like put their butt square in your logics and then go FK or spawn a whisper bubble.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.200
 They've just got like no concept of what's behind them. Which means like that's like another good thing like for everyone who's playing.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.400
 Be aware of your surroundings. So as an example here,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.000
 many of you I hope have some form of drink near you. It might be in a cup or a can or a bottle or whatever it is.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.400
 You know where that is and you have knowledge about where that is.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.000
 So you're not gonna just like, you know, flail your arms around or whatever and knock it over.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.640
 The same thing needs to happen in VR.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.360
 Like if you're standing in an area, be aware of what's behind you to the left of you to the right of you. The amount of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.960
 times I just get like

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.880
 unsolicited like butts in my face because people just aren't aware of their surroundings about where people are is just amazing.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.240
 Like, you know, if VR has this gigantic field of view,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.600
 use it.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.720
 Situational and positional awareness of things. Don't knock over that cup. Don't go AFK inside someone's logics.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.520
 I'll just kick you these days because like you clearly don't understand boundaries or anything like that.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.520
 If you go AFK inside my logics.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.360
 Beyond that another thing I've considered doing but I don't know if people would be up for or joining is

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:13.320
 similar to the prime exhibition thing is making it so spectators can't spawn their own avatar and so spectators are muted. At that point

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.080
 it sort of becomes stuffy though and you sort of turns into sort of like a performance piece

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.280
 where it's like welcome to the theater.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.000
 Prime is at the center of the theater on stage playing the violin. You're expected to be quiet whilst this happens.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 So I don't really know if that actually works.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.520
 I think I had to do that once because I was just like, you know, people just get it.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.800
 Once people understand it, they get kind of like good at it. I've had lots of experience with people sort of

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.440
 have been watching me build stuff for a bit and then other people come in and the new people that come in kind of sort

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.240
 of get wrangled by the old people. It's like hey, you know come over here, Prime's building, we can chat over here, right?

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.720
 They're over in the corner like enjoying memes and stuff and still engaging conversation with me

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.160
 but they're kind of self wrangling themselves into a corner. Honestly though

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.600
 I think one of the bigger things you can do is expose people to that being a problem.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.560
 I noticed a lot of people hide in private worlds, which is absolutely fine.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.300
 But if the reason that you're hiding in a private world is because you can't set boundaries with people that enter your world

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.020
 then perhaps try setting boundaries in your open world, right?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.880
 There is a problem in

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.800
 the furry community in general where confrontation of any kind is avoided

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.680
 and I actually want to change that. Like I had an idea,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.440
 I probably won't do it particularly whilst this, you know, messy announcements channel is in place, of

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.160
 doing like a Neos debate club. Like the reason why they do debate clubs at like high schools, etc. is to get people

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.800
 used to the idea that having differing opinions is okay and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.860
 having healthy discussions about those differing opinions is also okay.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.180
 A good example I give to people is your favorite color is not my favorite color and that's fine.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.020
 No one needs to be angry about it. No one needs to be upset about it.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.180
 But it just seems like particularly with the furry community when there is any disagreement whatsoever

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.840
 it turns into like a gigantic deal that can lead to sort of like I'll cancel you on Twitter proportions over just like silly things.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.280
 It's like just like recognize that not everyone is out to be a vicious attacker at you.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.120
 Some are of course, but let them prove to you that that's what they're there to do.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.700
 Don't assume that that's what they're there to do. I met this person in in Viaca over the weekend and

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.760
 they were saying something along the lines of like there were lots of

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.000
 Brazilian population were in the world and he was actually, you know, trying to learn the language.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.040
 We had another Brazilian who was translating for us. It was quite a good conversation.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.600
 But this person who was learning it

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.540
 or sort of lamenting about like how it was easier for people to learn languages when they're younger

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.680
 and you know, I piped up and said, you know, you're absolutely right. Here's why etc.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.680
 And then I said but you're doing a good job

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.580
 like, you know, because I could recognize that they were doing a good job.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.480
 But for some reason they they took that as like a personal attack. I was like, yeah, it is gonna be harder for you.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.680
 But you are doing a good job. I was basically complimenting them on the fact that they were doing a good job.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:11.640
 But they were like, oh, hang on a minute. Like I told you you were doing a good job and explained why it's harder.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.000
 That's that's all I did.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.520
 And it was okay if like that was the only time it happened, but like pretty much everything I said to them

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.600
 they treated it as like an attack and I'm just like hey just like chill out, please. So yeah set boundaries.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.440
 There's nothing wrong with saying like hey, can you move backwards a bit?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.640
 If they can't see on Twitter over that then they weren't worth speaking to in the first place.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.760
 Moving onwards to Fance conversation. Question even.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.000
 Fance says, is there a method

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.340
 stroke app to clean the assets folder and see the dependencies and links in the hierarchy explicitly?

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.520
 I've tried to use the asset tool in the us, but it deleted objects that I want to keep in my entire tavern.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.720
 So I'm having trust issues of that tool. It depends how you're using it.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.100
 I know of one user who will remain unnamed because it was a really unfortunate thing.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:02.400
 They put their entire world inside the assets folder in the slot hierarchy and it deleted itself because that's what the asset folder is meant to do.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.640
 So don't do that.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.280
 I've seen one person that does that so I presume other people might be accidentally doing that. And then the thing there is to understand

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.720
 what is going on there with that asset folder. By default in the session settings page

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.040
 you've got the clean up unused assets checked on. That should always be checked on.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.760
 There's no reason to have it not checked on. That will be cleaning up unused assets.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.000
 Like so you shouldn't need to do anything there.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.320
 The problem that you might have though is where the

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.840
 Neo system thinks the assets are still being used and won't remove them from that folder.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.800
 I honestly wouldn't worry about it

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.480
 but if you are going to worry about it

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.440
 make sure that you close the world and reopen it. Because just closing the world and reopening it will like clear out a lot.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.680
 Like for example, if someone comes into your world spawns out a bunch of shit, like it's gonna be in the assets folder for a while.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.280
 But if you close the world and reopen it to continue working on it, that asset folder will be cleaned up.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.780
 Additionally remember things such as the pink trashcan is the best thing for handling those assets. Beyond that

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.240
 I'd have to take a look at exactly what you're doing in that world because there might be some issues there.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.640
 But provided the automatically clean up checkbox is enabled, you shouldn't have to use that tool there.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.840
 That tool should be entirely safe. It just you just you have to figure out what you're doing.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.260
 Lex jumping around because Lex says I know one reason to turn off that checkbox.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.280
 Model plan emotions in a model only the first one gets set up and it will delete the rest since they're not referenced.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.800
 You can prevent that by putting a component called an asset provider or asset loader.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:32.540
 I think it's one of those. The asset provider or asset loader will keep the asset loaded in the world and prevent it from being

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.800
 chunked up.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.480
 So try that. I don't remember if it's loader or provider though, so try both.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:47.320
 You shouldn't usually need to do that because I don't know if it's like this in the hierarchy tree, but

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.280
 the like static mesh and

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:58.560
 animation you do to add like those sorts of components they might inherit the behavior from the asset loader component.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.540
 So don't like go adding them for everything.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:07.380
 You only need to add it in the particular case where you're sort of swapping out the references to multiple animations.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.420
 If you search for asset load or asset provider in this discord, I think you'll even find a lovely

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:19.060
 fruit something about them. I'll still wait for another question. I'm gonna cut this loose thread out of my clothing. There we go.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.380
 Vacuum. I'm gonna do that immediately following this. I'm gonna vacuum.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.200
 Okay, we have another question. Does slot order affect the order in which a world is loaded and if so, how strictly?

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.200
 I don't know, but I wouldn't want you

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.260
 doing it that way. I don't think it does.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.820
 Biggest thing you can do for world loading is make sure that you watch the very very very first tutorial

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.760
 I ever made and set your floor collider up correctly.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.200
 So many people don't do that or they put like a

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.500
 cylinder procedural mesh in the floor because they don't understand how the floor stuff works.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.200
 So they're just like, well if the world doesn't load you'll land on the cylinder and I'm like, oh you could just make it

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.460
 so I hover in the air until the floor loads and they're like how?

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.720
 And I'm like, it's only the first tutorial I ever ever recorded.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.060
 That says I guess I made a mistake setting up the world. I have a lot in that folder holders.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.240
 I don't know what you mean by holders.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.640
 Holders get spawned a lot when using red X, but they shouldn't occur in normal world operations.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.280
 So I really don't know what you're doing, but I think you're doing something wrong.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.280
 You shouldn't have anything inside the asset folder

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.960
 that you've explicitly put there. If you have to go in there, you should question why you should go in there.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.800
 Like of course you can, I'm not saying you can't. I'm just saying like if you have to go in there

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.160
 it means that you're into some pretty advanced stuff like regular

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.560
 like world building shouldn't mean anyone to go in that folder or take a look at it.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.240
 Oh, yeah, there is there is like holder dash assets in there. Yeah. Yeah, just like

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.440
 move everything outside of that folder that is stuff that you've added to the world yourself.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.360
 You shouldn't be putting stuff in there.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.320
 I'd love to sort of get some way to sort of separate it from the rest of the components and slots in the hierarchy

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.320
 so it's more clear because now we've had two people that I know of that have made that mistake, but

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:09.480
 nothing you make should go in there. As for seeing the links, no, there's no way to see the links there.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.320
 But like I said, you shouldn't need to go in there. Like it should be automatically taken care of.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.640
 The automatically clean up asset checkbox in the session settings should be doing everything for you.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.240
 As should when you restart the world, it should flush out all the sort of guns, lasers and avatars people spawn in.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.520
 Don't like don't go in there. If you're like hyper optimizing, which I know I know the Discord love,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.160
 they're like, oh my god, let's like avoid logics because it's bad. It's not bad.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.760
 Let's like mono pack because that makes it better. It really doesn't make it that much better.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:48.440
 Let's like, you know, discuss the intricacies between value driver and value copy and I'm like, oh my god,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.440
 just like I get it, but like relax a little bit.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.000
 Like there is such a thing as like too much optimization. The most complicated world

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.780
 I've ever done is my virtual surgical planning world.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:07.000
 I haven't thought about optimization ever. It runs at 90 FPS when we're doing surgery.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.640
 So like I have never thought about optimizing it.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.760
 There's lots of stuff I could do but it runs at 90 FPS when there's three surgeons in there discussing a surgery.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.760
 So I don't really care.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:24.340
 All right, let's take a look. Specs asks, why is it sometimes I can't use fly locomotion if I haven't walked or initialized the floor yet?

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:30.400
 Yeah, that's just like fly locomotion is physical locomotion. So it's probably still waiting for the floor collider to be there.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.080
 I've also experienced the thing where like you have to walk on it once before you can fly.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.320
 That might be a bug in the fly locomotion preset.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.140
 But we'd have to look look into that one.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.840
 It might just be because like the physical locomotion was like just slightly

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.460
 gently hammered to make the fly locomotion.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:58.480
 So maybe that's the problem. Shadow says, I'm curious just how some worlds have dedicated loading zones that always load first.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.480
 Give me an example and we can go take a look at it. We can load into it and inspect a bunch of stuff.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.040
 Simple things tend to load faster though.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:15.880
 So like text and just like a standard material that just has a color on it. That doesn't need to load texture files.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.440
 So sometimes that would just load faster just because it's simple.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.160
 So that might be what they're doing. I'll have to see what they're doing.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.580
 There is the possibility that there is some sort of mod that allows you to sort of interface in that system or somehow

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.880
 I don't know. There's nothing I can think of the top of my head.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.160
 I can like go look there now, but I will run out of time quickly if I just went and did that.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.320
 All right, I'm Aaron has a question.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.720
 Do you think it'd be good idea for the future for Neos to officially make versions of user-created systems such as world cleanup systems or

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720
 world coloring systems?

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.960
 Yes.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.140
 Something which is like always been part of Neos's philosophy is

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:59.840
 allowing you to customize everything whilst also providing sort of sane defaults. Good example being the avatar system.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.840
 It's called the common avatar system because you can make other avatar systems.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:11.440
 I've yet to see anyone that actually does this. Closest would be the any land folks who do it in a good way.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:17.840
 But I think it's wrong. I think Frix intended you to do it slightly differently, but like hey, it doesn't matter.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:26.360
 There are ways to avoid using the common avatar system to make avatars that Frix has talked about before but hasn't really explained.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.720
 But the point is we would probably provide some sort of automated system to do it in the future.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:39.720
 But that would be sort of an optional system that maybe would would enable on new worlds by default just to give new users or

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:46.160
 new world creators a good thing. Maybe there'll be a panel or configuration dialogue to turn it off if you want to use your own one.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.280
 But we're never going to prevent

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.680
 the community from making their own.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.160
 Particularly if they think their own is better in some way for some feature.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.280
 But yeah, it would be good idea to have good sane defaults. I want a good sane default for culling.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:07.840
 Audio zones, I want to fix up that. It's wrong. I don't know what's wrong about it, but it's wrong right now.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.840
 I shouldn't be able to hear someone from like

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.880
 miles away on the map, but doesn't make any sense.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.080
 World cleanup is a difficult one.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.360
 Because while yeah, we could totally add that as a native system that also is again a social thing.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.920
 People need to be told and taught that that is a problem that they are making MS.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:34.960
 Another good one is gestures. Like I just I hate hand-based gestures with a passion.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.880
 And you can't convince me elsewhere.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.520
 I use my hands a lot when talking anyway.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.080
 And so I don't have time for them to be in particular hand shapes to make me smile or whatever.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.600
 That's just it just it's it's not the way that it's meant to be done. The face tracker would be closer to all the way

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.360
 it's meant to be done.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.760
 But like it's not meant to be hand driven.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.120
 Like there are some people that for example like if their hand is closed their eyes are closed.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.440
 I'm just like what if you're holding something? Doesn't make any sense to me.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.320
 But having said that we may want to add a

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:17.000
 standard system for that that's really easy to use. I'm thinking like you know select the gesture point, select the thing you want to do, done.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.320
 I know that there are tons of community-made systems that do that.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.600
 But they always have a point where you can see that they're not native.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:32.640
 Like what was one actually in the in the MMC this year, and it was like almost perfect

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.000
 but didn't work with my avatar for some reason.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.560
 And also you know requires a lot of haggy stuff behind the scene to sort of find an open inspector.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.320
 It's just like it shouldn't be complicated.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.080
 So again making that system will be good. Again of course allowing for people to make their own.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.800
 I'm happy so I have to do thumbs up or I'm not happy.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.920
 Oh, I want to be sad so I have to like you know do the American Sign Language sign for like

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:06.240
 poo poo poo poo, and then my like face turns into like a sad face. Like it just it

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.120
 There's this TV show called The Magicians

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:15.640
 which is a magic show and well that makes it sound like you know pulling rabbits out of a hat.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.080
 It's a show about magic. It's really good, but

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.080
 they have a very particular way of doing magic which is

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.760
 incredibly hand-based and

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:32.320
 I always think whatever like I see people in VRChat are like yeah, that that looks like exactly what you're doing with your hands

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.800
 just to make yourself smile.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:40.520
 I'm just looking at the gifts available for the show because I don't want any spoilers because there are so many like

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:48.920
 You know some shows have like really big spoilers like you know season 12 this person dies season 13 this person like

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:57.080
 commits mass murder or whatever like Magicians has got like five or so of that like level of spoiler per season

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.080
 so like it's very difficult.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.520
 Okay, here's the here's the closest gift. I don't even remember the context of this one

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.840
 but like it's just like it's so over the top and

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.200
 all he gets is a glowy bracelet, and I don't remember what the glowy bracelet does.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.880
 No

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.960
 I'd have to look at the the timing

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.440
 but Magicians is based on a book series that describes these hand movements quite well as far as I remember.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.400
 It's Dr. Strange is always weird because they

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.120
 they just summon like orange circles.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:36.160
 It's all they do and then that's what you don't like you see in the films you see all of the sort of acolytes

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.920
 I guess they're all just like summoning orange circles and then Dr. Strange and

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.600
 the other guy the Asian guy he like they're the only ones that get to do like what looks like any

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.320
 anything that isn't an orange circle.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.800
 Moving on to actual questions.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.240
 It's a really good show guys you should you should watch it if anyone does watch it when you're done

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.600
 there's like five seasons so come back after five seasons. Let me know you'll be glad.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.600
 There's a musical episode per season as well, and it always makes sense it doesn't feel forced.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.000
 Anyway back to questions.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:14.080
 Ered says if you were to make a gesture system how would you personally have users interact with it? Would it be a component that drives blend chips or would it be a logic system?

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.300
 It it would not be obvious to the user that they are

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.600
 doing anything technical and that's the big challenge.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.640
 If you think about things like actually here's a good example

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:31.160
 an installer for an application on your computer when you install an application on your computer

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:37.560
 you're just going next next next on a wizard right maybe you select which folder or hard drive it goes to or what parts of the

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.560
 software you want, but you're not doing anything really technical there

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.000
 you're just making choices, and then you're hitting next. You can install applications another way

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.760
 which is downloading a zip unzipping it and then run the EXE that happens a lot with more

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.040
 open source based applications because they don't have the

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.960
 will or in some cases the money to make a standard installer application

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:03.260
 and then that's you know more technical and then you get the amazingly technical thing

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.840
 which is trying to install nvidia drivers on Linux like right now gesture systems without

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:14.040
 things that made like the MMC one I mentioned they feel like trying to install nvidia graphics card drivers on Linux

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.960
 with the systems they feel like you know downloading and extracting a zip archive

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.960
 but what I want is just like the installation wizard you know where it's like ah

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.120
 you know welcome to the avatar setup

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:31.120
 what do you want to do and then like oh I want it to serve my like thumbs up like I do the like closed eyes

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.300
 and my eyes are smiley and my face is smiley and like you know

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.300
 candy

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.500
 candy cane falls out my ears great cool. We'll set that up for you without any technicalities

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.100
 I don't really know what that looks like blend shapes are totally easy

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:52.060
 And the other thing is like with a Neos built one we could handle the multiple blend shapes driving problem

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.200
 Which is like one of the like major

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.160
 major like bottlenecks I see in people's brains when it comes to gestures they can't they can't

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.020
 make the sort of

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.120
 intuition about how to do that

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.400
 Whereas we could just handle that right they would they would maybe select their gestures

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.560
 And then we would just behind the scenes we would do it however we wanted to do it drive nose components

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.080
 Whatever you want. Shadow says speaking of ease of use do you think a GPT

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.120
 4 powered knee assistant could be possible in the future. Yeah sure I mean it'll probably be a plug-in right now

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.500
 and the reason is because

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.420
 You guys integrating it perfectly fine us integrating it we're gonna have to pay

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.540
 Open air money the other thing is like AI is growing exponentially

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.900
 But I want to make sure that enough people understand

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:46.200
 What's actually happening which is all GPT 4 does is it predicts the most likely next character in a response?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.920
 And it looks really good

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.620
 But like it does make errors and I worry that like a lot of people are going like it looks cool because it works 90%

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.340
 Of the time, but like it's really bad in some cases. It's almost like remember that thing at school where

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:05.140
 You know you were told you couldn't use Wikipedia for your research. It's like oh, okay

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:11.740
 Why it's like oh because Wikipedia doesn't validate its sources it does and it did at the time that you're in school, but

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:16.120
 It's the crew of doing that and Wikipedia does not validate its sources, right?

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.040
 It doesn't validate its sources because in some cases it doesn't understand its sources right its sources

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.100
 Just oh, it's a 80% chance that an E occurs after this character

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.940
 I will put an either even if it makes no sense. It just happens to make sense a lot of the time

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.940
 I also don't know how it would handle

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:40.780
 Continually to being updated right so the problem is right now. I don't know V for as I'm a little too V for was enough

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:46.920
 But I knew that V3 was up to sort of the end of 2021 so it's already two years out of date

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.240
 We need to get to a point where we can feed new information into it like it needs

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.380
 Let's say there's a new update to Neos it has a new component and new logics node

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.540
 We need to know about that and so we'd probably need like sub brains

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:06.120
 I think is the term where we're able to update its knowledge based on the Neos update notes based on new documentation

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:13.980
 Right now that would require probably like additional training or retraining. I don't know how that would work thought Bing was a different model

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.500
 oh well

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:21.020
 It's something that like I probably should have got into if I wasn't in like Neos

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:27.520
 Sometimes I'm just like if Neos didn't exist like would I have more or less

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.220
 money fun fame happiness

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:37.260
 Excitement with my day, and I don't I don't know at this point. You know I was really into motor sports

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:42.060
 I hate motor sport racing, but I was into the technical parts of it. I would never get on a motorcycle

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.060
 You couldn't pay me a million dollars to get on a motorcycle

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:49.620
 But I was into the sport racing as a technical thing because that was my job, and it was really fun

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:54.900
 Then that died and I found mixer, and it was like cool. I'm into video game streaming

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.820
 I guess and then it was like yeah, but I'm on my own in my bedroom

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.380
 Living room, and it was like cool. I'll put on this VR headset

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:07.980
 I bought and it was VRChat VRChat VRChat, and it's like oh Neos is cool. Yeah, Prime doesn't even ride a scooter

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.460
 I have one of those like electric scooters. I'm just terrified of it

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.740
 I used to own a one-wheel if anyone knows the one-wheel yeah, you probably understand why I sold it

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.080
 Those things are just scary I used to be quite proficient at riding it

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:24.980
 But I felt like I was gonna die whilst riding it so I I saw that here we go

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.820
 Here's a gif of a man riding a one-wheel so it's self balancing via

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.780
 like Sentra what's from a call it force and

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.080
 You lean forward to go faster lean back to go slower

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:44.220
 If you push it too far by leaning forwards too much or going at too high a speed it will

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:49.760
 Adjust its velocity to tell you you're going too fast by

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.820
 the result you get there is it will tip backwards and that's saying bro slow down and

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:01.060
 90% of one-wheel users ignore that and they push even faster and

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.500
 Then it just cuts out because it can't keep you balanced anymore

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.060
 And then you face plant onto the floor, and it's like the number one complaint with those things

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.580
 But it's mentioned in the safety manual, but no one reads it so you know there. We go. I was riding it

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:19.540
 Let's just say like one quarter of that speed it has like modes in the app

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:26.160
 But you can set it on and they're all called like really like space age things like Sequoia and stuff like that

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.980
 But basically it's like baby a little bit less of a baby, and I want to break my face

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.300
 It's like the last mode. I don't know what it's actually called, but it's pretty much that yeah, I sold it

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.300
 I sold it for like pretty much

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.940
 The same I bought it from as well, which is amazing and when I gave it to the person

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.200
 I was like you know this will like kill you if you're not careful right and he's like yeah

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.260
 I've got one of the small ones. I think they're called pints

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.580
 I just wanted to upgrade to the big one and I'm like okay

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:55.740
 Just don't kill yourself then he gave me the money and I kind of just left knowing he might accidentally kill himself

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.740
 But there we go

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:03.220
 I don't recommend them the whole idea was to get that and then one wheel to the officer back, but then you know I

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.260
 Scary anyway that we are at half past

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.080
 I'm gonna go ahead and leave off here if you have any additional questions people in the questions that help Channel

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:16.460
 DM me or whatever you'd like oh and one final note make tickets like if you have a moderation issue make tickets

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:21.200
 I got a few DMS this week, and it's just like make a ticket. It's moderation make a ticket

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.840
