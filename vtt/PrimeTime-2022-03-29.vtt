WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Okay. So it's 4 p.m. That means it's time for office hours with prime. So drop your

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.400
questions in the office hours text chat and we will get them answered in turn. Reminder

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.880
for this week, we are recording this and it will be uploaded to sounder which will then

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.320
transcribe it. Still working with how that will work. I had feedback last week to the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.080
developers of the application. Their transcription editor is a bit weird, but they are working

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.280
on it. Once that's fixed, I should be able to download that transcription as a VST file

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.640
which is a lot easier to format than the current presentation on sounder. But hey, we're working

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.000
on it. The idea is just to automate as much as possible because automation is cool. I've

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.320
noticed that it gets me when I mispronounce stuff, it gets them completely wrong. So I

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.960
have to concentrate on pronouncing stuff appropriately. So I don't see any questions in the office

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.120
hours text chat. So please drop them in if you have questions. I'm just going to sit

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:14.720
here and make funny noises occasionally. Of particular note this week, it was a small

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.640
change to my modern plugin policy. The only change there was just a small clarification

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.280
on the GitHub reporting. It's not a requirement, it's just a request. If you would like, you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.640
can drop your GitHub drop your links on GitHub to the mods that solve a problem. We do encourage

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.440
it though. If we don't know that your mod is solving a problem, then we can't fix it.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.300
Ideally if your mod is solving a problem which lots of users face, I would love to actually

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.120
include it in Neo's actuality. A good example there being the inspector alignment fix. So

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.560
I think it was RT that made that one originally as a mod. I then implemented it into Neo's

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.240
So Monik is speaking about the controller mod that disables tank controls. That is a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.080
perfect example of something that will go into the new settings panel. For those unaware,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.320
on our roadmap is the settings panel. We'll be reworking the settings panel such that

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.960
we can fit unlimited settings. You know the unlimited power gif, just imagine it with

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.560
Frux's face. If someone would actually edit this, I will love you forever. I want Frux's

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:00.120
face on, what's his face, Darth, I've forgotten his name, Palpatine, Emperor Palpatine. Yeah,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.520
Frux's face on Emperor Palpatine, change the lighting to yellow and then unlimited settings,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.480
that would be the new settings panel. And the new settings panel will allow just unlimited

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.000
settings and at that point he'll basically be like, what do you want a setting for? Cool,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.600
it's implemented. Now it won't be fast depending on what it is, we still have to write code

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.520
for that setting, but the idea is that we can make settings for that. There are a couple

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.400
of things which the modding community know are just booleans and they're like, why can't

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.800
you just put a checkbox on the settings screen? If you look at the settings screen, we're

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:47.680
out of room. We're just out of room. We can shoehorn new settings in, but we're just taking

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.520
the starts, hey, let's redo the settings thing, because remember, all work takes time and

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.360
we don't want to do work that we can undo or have to undo. And the settings panel is

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:14.520
something we have to undo. Tap dancing, I guess. I see no other questions, so I'm going

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.320
to sit here and look at all the emails that are coming in for me, because I'm having a

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:30.720
busy week this week.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:54.160
We have a question. I'm so happy we have a question. Keep them coming. Specs asks, speaking

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.280
of mods, I currently use a mod that makes my inspector match my user color. Very handy

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.680
for organizing when there's a bunch of people building together any thoughts on places where

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.880
user color may be useful in general. I'd like to see it. As many places as it makes sense.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.120
We could use it on other panels, like logic panels. We could use it on just sort of all

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.480
sorts of things. For those who aren't aware, the user color is a facet, which is available

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.280
in the essentials, which changes a cloud variable, which is sort of like your selected color.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.320
I wouldn't say favorite color, but lots of people do make it their favorite color. The

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.000
new default headset and hands avatar will use that color for the color of the headset

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.040
and hands, so you can customize it. And you can tie into it. It's a cloud variable that

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.840
anyone can read, so anyone can take a look at that and be like, cool, I want my inspector

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.160
to be that color. The important thing with colors, being that I'm slightly colorblind,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.160
is that you don't use it as the single descriptor of who something is. If inspectors have the

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.280
concept of being owned, then maybe put their username in the title bar or something like

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.660
that. We don't want to just say, like, cool, stop prime, that's a red inspector, that belongs

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:17.200
to the specs, you can't touch that inspector. Maybe I don't know it's red. It should be

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.200
clear. It's good for organization. It also lets me sort of identify that one person who

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.080
has an inspector two feet to the left for the exact same object but opens up another

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.920
one anyway, because, you know, they like that one better. I do that all the time. Don't

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.640
worry. Everyone does. They're like, cool. I know there's one over here, but I need one

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:49.840
over here. Yeah. It's fun. There are some times where I have to, like,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.960
stop when I'm building and I close all my inspectors down and then I become really descriptive

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.000
about them. I'm like, okay, I need one for this, I need one for that. Because always

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.280
I'm just juggling them around and it's just it gets chaotic. When I was doing the MMC

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.120
coding system again this year, I just sufficiently needed three different locations but kept

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:16.760
using the location one for location three and swapping it around. So I just had to stop,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.080
close all the inspectors and say, okay, this is the location one inspector, this is the

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.040
location two inspector, this is the location three inspector. I could make copies of those

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.120
by grabbing the top of the inspector, the slot, and then primary triggering, and that

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.600
would make a copy of it. Fantastic. But important thing being that those three always existed

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:42.640
so I could quickly refer to them. I guess that's maybe a sort of signaler that

00:07:42.640 --> 00:08:03.240
inspector-based shortcuts for a session might be a good feature. Hey, roadmap, new inspectors,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:24.760
I need one for this, I need one for that, I need one for that, I need one for that.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:35.600
This is a great question. I haven't had a lot of good geospaced guides related to transforms

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.960
vectors, Cartesian coordinates, 3D space, et cetera. Is there a good starting point

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.800
you could recommend for those of us who have forgotten what we learned in trig or don't

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.440
do game development as our game job? I don't know, but I'd actually recommend you look

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:57.920
at the problem from a game development point of view. Here's one I came across in making

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.880
a game many years ago, I needed a 2D missile shot from a spaceship to angle itself towards

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:10.980
the player spaceship and crash into it. There's actually a lot of maths in that, and instead

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:18.760
of learning trigonometry from the sort of, you know, oh, let's do 50 exercises based

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:26.160
on it, I just Googled that exact problem and got the mathematics for it, and I learnt the

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.800
mathematics for it in a sort of reverse point of view. I learnt the solution using the problem,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.240
and then by learning the solution, I learnt the generic math concept there. You're looking

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:46.600
for 8 and 2, if you want to do that. Something to do with the rotation compared to the, like,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:56.360
blah, blah, blah. I also really want to learn trigonometry using tau, which is 2 times pi,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.720
rather than pi, because pi is kind of silly. If you learn it using tau, it's a lot easier.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.960
I also want to learn trigonometry using radians rather than degrees, because I hear it's a

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:13.160
lot easier to work with radians for those sort of, I'm going to say fixed in your ways,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.800
I don't mean it negatively, I just mean this is how education teaches you it, so it's understandable.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.000
Doing rotational maths using degrees is actually harder than it needs to be. Doing it in radians

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.480
is apparently easier, and the reason behind that is that radians are a float-based sort

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:37.360
of arithmetic system, whereas degrees are like, well, 360 is, got to go back to zero.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.780
Radians you can just keep going, stuff like that. So it makes some of the maths easier,

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.760
but it is sort of like rip out your existing knowledge and put in new knowledge to learn

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:57.520
it. You can't, you have to just forget what you know, I guess, a little bit. In my public

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.600
folder, in utilities or tools, I don't remember which, there is a three-dimensional cone,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:12.400
not cone, a cylinder, which maps the colour values of RGB onto a cylinder. Not RGB, yeah,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.920
RGB. No, no, huge saturation of value, yeah. Because I was trying to explain the concept

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.520
of how colour was a three-dimensional number, and someone didn't understand that so I made

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.200
it into a cone, but I couldn't get the maths right, and I was using degrees, and earth

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.880
mark came in, and he just converted all the maths to using radians, and it was like half

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:38.960
the nodes. I don't know why. Every time I look at it, I'm like, that makes sense, and

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.840
then I pack it and I forget instantly. There's a number of things in life that are exactly

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:52.240
like that. Someone will explain it to me and then I'll just instantly forget it. The one

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.920
that comes to mind is the difference between, in military, between an enlisted officer and

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.560
a commissioned officer. I still don't quite understand that, and don't explain it to me,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.600
I'll forget instantly. It's just a plague of my life. Every time it becomes important

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:14.280
for a conversation, I'll relook it up. Another one being voltage. I don't understand what

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:23.280
voltage is in a circuit, and again, don't explain it to me, I'll forget. I would have

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.320
had a lot better time learning electronics if I just accepted that voltage was a thing

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.600
and I didn't question what it was. Same goes with languages as well. I had a lot of struggle

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.200
learning languages because I'm like, why does French, German, et cetera, why does each word

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.720
need a gender? Why does it have a gender? Who decides what the gender of it is? If I

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:51.880
just accepted it, it did. Sometimes in education there is a warranted part of just accepting

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:58.320
that you are given this knowledge because you need to learn it. Not in maths though,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.880
screw maths. I learnt maths so much easier in 3D. I've actually considered doing this.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.920
I know that Tom Fox is trying to do it and looking at tools to help them do it. Teach

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:14.680
and tutor using Neos to describe mathematical constructs and stuff. But I was wondering

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.920
if I could branch out my Neos tutorials to just like pure mathematics tutorials. Lesson

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.560
1, Pythagoras theorem with prime. It would be in Neos and look like a Neos tutorial but

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.440
it would actually be learning core math and therefore someone who might not be interested

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:44.480
in Neos itself would still learn core math from that tutorial.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:14:03.900
Like as an example, I was never given this picture when Pythagoras was explained to me.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:10.160
So I didn't understand what squaring a number meant. But here it's quite easy to see. When

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:17.500
you square that number, you get the area of that square. So the area of square A plus

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.920
the area of square B is the area of square C. And you're just like, oh, that makes a

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:29.720
lot more sense. And you can actually do that with squares if you've got a unit square.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.260
Sometimes the angles get funky but you can fill it up. At a museum there's a demonstration

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.640
of Pythagoras which uses water. So you have a triangle one way up which is the A and B

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.360
side and it's got two chambers full of water and they fill up to show the area of chamber

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.880
A and chamber B of water. And then you spin the triangle sort of upside down and it drains

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:55.500
the water from chamber A and chamber B into chamber C and it fills up to the fill line

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:04.200
in chamber C. And again that was like, oh, that's like that's how Pythagoras works? Cool.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:12.360
And you could totally animate that in VR. Because that's not even mathematics at that

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:20.720
point. That's just like if you had the containers, you could get like a cup and explain Pythagoras

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:44.640
using a cup of water and a box. Yeah, here it is. It's not the same rig as in the museum.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:16:01.760
It looks like a homemade one but it's like identical. Specs says I've heard that sometimes

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.840
you just have to learn something in the simple but slightly wrong way before you have the

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.680
knowledge and understanding to actually learn it in the right and fully defined way. Which

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:14.520
can be annoying but you can be annoying when you want to say teach someone how to do something

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.920
in Neos the best way but it might be too difficult to understand without having soaked in Neos

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.760
long enough. That's a good description of the problem I continually see which is when

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.280
someone in this Discord asks about a question and they're trying to do it in logics, like

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:35.280
they're trying to change a Boolean using logics and someone goes, just use button toggle!

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:41.480
Just use button toggle! Button toggle! They're trying to learn logics here so can we please

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.680
Boolean latch just for now and then maybe suggest, hey, if you'd like to learn a way

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:53.600
to do this without logics, button toggle! Starting with just like, you know, stop what

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:03.000
you're doing, throw it all out, it's wrong, use button toggle, not a good way to learn.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Grinch says would be great to have text description of each item in logics browser and some sort

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.880
of hint. That is on the roadmap for our UI rework. You can check out our roadmaps on

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:22.880
the GitHub. Much, much, much more in-game documentation is planned on that roadmap.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:48.280
That's actually meant to be what I'm doing, but I do a lot of other stuff.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:59.400
There's a lot of actual mathematics that can be explained using geometry and I really do

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:07.400
like that. I don't remember what video it was. Actually, I do. It was a theorem or something

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.720
and they were explaining quadratic equations using squares and again, I'm just like, maths

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:24.240
was never explained to me visually like this. When I see A squared, I'm just like, huh?

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:32.000
Retro Zvok asks I see some FPGA named DLL in Neos files, are you seriously using real

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.580
FPGA stuff inside Neos? That's an example plug in. I think the source is available somewhere.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.320
It's very ancient. I don't know if it still works. But it's an example plug in which was

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:47.000
written by Outsider. For those who are like, Outsider does nothing. They wrote that DLL.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.480
They also wrote a lot of the pass through outputs from the many No's, such as write.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:58.280
You know the on fail that comes out of write when it fails to write? That's Outsider. You

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.800
know the delay that has like two impulses, one which is when the impulse started and

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.800
one which is when the delay completes? That's Outsider. Anyway, the point being, that is

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:15.200
an old extension to Neos as a plug in. It provides FPGA simulation via logics. I don't

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.480
know how it works or what it looks like. I've never used it. But we're not doing real FPGA

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:31.320
stuff. It's a simulated FPGA. For those who don't know, that's a fully programmable gate

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:43.960
array and it's like cool. But it's really subjective for its use. Particularly in Neos.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:54.120
You can do a lot of field programmable. I'm now on the Wikipedia page. Haha. It's basically

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.880
for like, you know, when you need control over the actual silicone, that's what's doing

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:10.240
the sort of, you know, flow of your program. You can use FPGA. You shouldn't need to use

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.120
one in Neos. But there are a lot of cases where Neo stuff exists to teach other subjects

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:31.920
so much point, it's like, sure, go for it. Player Cody has a question. Player Cody asks,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.640
I was looking through a tutorial about making an image indicate someone is looking at their

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.320
belt menu inventory. I was looking to see if a GIF was possible, but the other video

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:46.080
regarding making a GIF in Neos was classified as outdated. I was not sure if making a GIF

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.120
is possible. So the GIF tutorial I have is like really a joke that I don't suggest doing.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:59.800
I just don't suggest using GIFs. I understand that GIFs are prolific in sort of Discord

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.520
and stuff like that. But like most places don't even use GIFs these days. Here it's

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:11.960
a, I've just posted a GIF in the chat. It's a ferret that runs and falls over. Let's take

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:19.800
a look at it. It's usually an MP4 or like, you know, it's often not a GIF. And the reason

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:26.080
is GIF is a really old format. It has kind of bad compression and stuff like that. There's

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:32.660
much more better fragments and things to use. And so Neos itself doesn't have GIF support.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.440
It's not because of that, but it's one of the reasons why we haven't prioritized it

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:42.960
is because there are other better formats available. So you can't really use a GIF.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.440
Retro just said APNG. Yeah, APNG might be a better thing. Animated WebPs. You can even

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:55.480
do animated JPEGs. I've learned MP4s is like, yeah. Zeko says 30 megabytes for a GIF where

00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:02.760
the MP4 is cut in half by 90. Yeah. GIFs are just like, there's a cultural problem about

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.960
them, right? Where, you know, when you want a funny image, you use a GIF. But the format

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.600
itself is usually not suitable. I do think eventually we'll have GIF support, but right

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:17.240
now we don't. Going on to speaking about ways of doing it, you can follow the outdated tutorial.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.720
You'll just have to sort of adapt to knowing it's not good. The two ways of doing it are

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.600
to stack the GIF frames on top of each other and go through them with a Boolean switcher.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.600
You don't do that. That's terrible. The other thing you can do is turn that GIF into a sprite

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.680
sheet. That happens a lot for badges. If you want to use an animated badge, using a sprite

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:41.360
sheet is a really good way of doing that. You turn the GIF frames into a sort of grid

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.360
of sprite sheets and then you iterate through them using UV Atlas animator. I have a tutorial

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.960
on both of those. If you're on my channel, just search for UV Atlas animator. But GIFs

00:22:50.960 --> 00:23:09.520
are kind of, like, bad. But hopefully we'll get them one day.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.640
Shadow also asks about MPNG. Yep. All the formats that aren't GIF are probably going

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:23.760
to overtake GIF completely at some point. Neos doesn't support APNG either. Just do

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:31.360
the sprite sheet method, do the Boolean switcher method or use a video.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.360
And this comes up a lot in the material world. Create mathematics or some sort of animation

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:45.840
that matches what you want. Like, I have some people that wanted I actually have them at

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.920
a lot, which is why there's a rainbow shader tutorial on my channel, which is named rainbow

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.720
shader because someone kept coming in and they were like, I want a rainbow shader. I

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.920
want my shoes to be rainbow shader. And I said, well, if you change what you're asking,

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.240
we can get you a rainbow shader. No, I need a rainbow shader. That's why I put it into

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.240
the search terms for that video, rainbow shader. It's a material where we animate the color

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:13.360
property and it turns rainbow. There's also that one, I believe it's in the

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:20.360
essential materials now, which does exactly what all the rainbow shaders for VRChat do,

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:39.800
using an image that scrolls. Oh, I missed a question. I'm terribly sorry.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:45.600
I'll jump up to that. Richard asks, speaking of DLLs, since DLLs are Windows only, how

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.400
will there be extensions on other platforms? We'll use wine. And then Specs has answered

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:58.480
it, which is here. Dot net and things like that can run it. Additionally, on other platforms

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:05.520
such as Linux, we use Mono. If you run Neos using the correct, like, flags, you can load

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.760
in the DLLs and it doesn't matter. Like, Neos will take care of loading the DLL. It doesn't

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:28.040
need Windows. Linux support is something we want to improve.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.520
We actually want Neos to be on any platform that's possible. Mac included. Basically,

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:41.240
we want Neos running on whatever we can. Phones, yes. Whatever, basically. Whatever we can,

00:25:41.240 --> 00:26:05.560
whenever we can. Check the roadmap. Retro, that's a question that is better served

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:11.520
for Microsoft folks. Of which I am one. But it's better served for Microsoft folks that

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:18.120
aren't in this Discord. They're asking about dot net and running telemetry data to Microsoft.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:35.880
I don't know. Ask Microsoft. We have another question here from Crusher

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.680
who asks are there plans to have a Neos format of sorts so items and avatars can be exported

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:47.620
with the functionality? Yes, check the roadmap. The tentative name of that is dot Neos package.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.620
But we are looking at the ways of doing that so we don't confuse the world. Like, I would

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.320
hate to do that and then people suddenly realize, like, oh, Neos has Unity package support.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:13.040
No, no, no. The complete opposite of that. It's just the tentative name, Mr. Electronus.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:24.800
We have tentative names for, like, a lot of things. You'll see sometimes references to

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:32.280
Gen X. I'm like, is this like DNA editing in Neos? What's going on? That's generation

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:41.560
X and it's for generation code. So it's things like, you know, more procedural meshes, more

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:47.920
terrain, stuff like that. A lot of Gen X got merged into procedural mesh framework. But

00:27:47.920 --> 00:28:03.280
it would probably include terrain information, et cetera.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.920
There's also business X, which was meant to have sort of more of the, like, business logic

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.720
stuff in. But again, that kind of went into, like, pro and stuff like that. There are,

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:17.020
like, a lot of holdovers from just workflow not being updated for a bit that we need to

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:22.120
work on. Such as, like, old projects don't exist or don't get copied over. They don't

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:32.040
do anything wrong. They just don't need to exist. So shrug.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:40.920
The naming convention for Neos stuff is basically just, like, who, like, you know, the name

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.960
of the DLL is just needed for, like, one second. Doesn't really matter. So it's just, like,

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:53.880
that's why you've got an X on the end. There's a question here, which is from Zeko.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.720
Is Neos planning on phasing out Unity in the future? Yeah. We're looking to go to our own

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.520
approach, probably using some sort of third-party rendering solution. But something that we're

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:12.240
in more control of. Forge and a bunch of other weird names are being looked at. Check the

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:28.280
thread, which is linked for more information. So we have another question here from

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:41.920
retro, who says I'm working on desktop functionalities with my VR chat avatar. Will these things

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:52.760
be in Neosend? And will that be de-Googled on Android phones, Linux, and BSD? I appreciate

00:29:52.760 --> 00:30:01.000
the commitment to your privacy. All of those things exist and work regardless of desktop.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.040
So we have systems that allow for head pats. They can count the number of head pats that

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.960
you have. Laying down, we have a pose system. I believe that can be used by desktop players.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.640
Play space height is controlled by various factors, but you don't usually need to edit

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.440
that. Please don't edit. Like, there are settings inside VR which I wish people wouldn't fiddle

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:29.000
with. As an example, Neosend settings panel has the height. It wants your height. I don't

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.800
care if you think you're six foot tall and you're actually five foot two. Put in five

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.760
foot two. That's what you're meant to put in there. If you want to be bigger in the

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:45.120
world or smaller in the world, use other mechanisms, please. There's things like default user scale,

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:50.680
the scaling tools themselves, scaling things by parenting, all sorts of stuff like that.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:56.080
Compare what you're meant to use. As for third person camera, as Froppy points out, yep,

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:03.240
F5 for third person camera. If you want a feature in your desktop mode, ask if we have

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.480
it. We usually do. If we don't, it can go on the roadmap or in most cases can actually

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:16.040
be built by the community. As for our plans for phones and Linux and other platforms in

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:23.280
the area, I don't foresee them requiring any Google stuff. We're just going to launch on

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:32.360
whatever platform we can whenever we can.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:51.480
Yeah. That's the one that we get a lot. It even happens on VRChat. People complain that

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:58.960
tracking is wrong or full body tracking doesn't make sense. I ask this in VRChat. What height

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:05.880
did you enter in the height setting? I entered eight foot, so I'm really big. Especially

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:11.400
for full body tracking, it needs to know how tall you are so it knows how tall you are

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:17.800
so it can do the mathematics about where your leg is, not where your avatar's leg is. It's

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:33.320
like a formula. It's like you plus your tracking points plus avatar settings equals good full

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.600
body tracking. People are just like, okay, that means I'll edit what I am. No, you can't

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:48.400
edit your height. That's not how it works.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:33:02.160
I see we're at time. So Fuzzy, if you have questions, go for it. Otherwise, no more questions.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:08.560
Like when I call people out when they're typing and then they immediately stop typing. Yeah,

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:16.240
I'll just ignore your question. Wearing shoes in full body tracking is always weird. Shouldn't

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:23.360
affect things that much, particularly because the trackers, if you are wearing shoes, it

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.360
goes on top of your like the arch of your foot, which means that like the heel step

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.240
usually doesn't get included.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:39.400
All right, that's all we've got. If you have other questions, please feel free to ask in

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.280
the Discord, ping me, read the Wiki, read the roadmap, et cetera. Let me know what I

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.200
can help you with. Spam me in DMs and I'll speak to you again next week. This will be

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.840
up on sounder shortly and I'll take a look at the transcript which will probably be terrible

00:33:51.840 --> 00:34:04.560
but who knows, we're experimenting with stuff. Jazz hands!
