00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 All right, it is the-- yeah, welcome to Office Hours

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.920
 with Prime.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.600
 My name is Prime.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.040
 So I got distracted there because I set up

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.560
 automation on Google Home to turn on my living room

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.880
 lights about 4 PM, because I will continually figure out

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.520
 at about 4 PM, we start needing lights.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.840
 So they just turned on the moment Office Hours hit.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.800
 It was like, bling, your lights turned on.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.440
 And I'm like, you're listening, lights?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.640
 What's going on?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.440
 Well, there we go.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.720
 Anyway, welcome to Office Hours.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.600
 This is where I answer questions that you guys might have.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.040
 Please drop them in the Office Hours text chat thread,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.720
 and I'll get to them in order that they arrive.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.420
 I'm just going to ping Office Hours again,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.720
 and then we'll go ahead and get started with my questions.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.640
 So Jack asks-- they first of all say party time.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.360
 It's not a party.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.120
 It's Office Hours.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.600
 Very serious, Office Hours.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.240
 You've got to put on your tweed jacket, get some coffee,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.960
 and sit in the big professor hallway thing.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.640
 Yes.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360
 Anyway, and then asks, how have you been?

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.240
 I am tired and itchy, and I need to go grocery shopping,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.760
 but I'm not going grocery shopping until this is over.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.040
 Yes, that's how I am.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.680
 That's the only question we have so far.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080
 So until we have additional questions,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.000
 I'm going to sit here in unimaginable silence.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.760
 So make sure you get some questions sorted.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.120
 Gray Foxen says, the Prime means more British things,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.920
 like bad weather and milk and tea, says Jack.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.320
 Jack even.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.840
 I have lots of British things.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.240
 I have a cup of tea next to me.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.120
 It was last night's tea, so it's empty, but you know.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.360
 Svekin asks, what would be the best way to play a sound only

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.600
 when, say, a tap is being rotated and only when it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.840
 being rotated?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.680
 Do remember that a joint and also a slider,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.600
 they both act as actually grabables.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.440
 They do in programming what's called

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.320
 extending from a grabable.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.240
 So all of the grabable nodes work with joints and sliders.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.800
 So if you want to get an event when someone starts grabbing

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.200
 a joint, use on grabable grab, and on grabable released,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.240
 I think it is, when they stop grabbing a joint.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.480
 Then based on that, you can do some logic

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.880
 to take a look at how fast it's being rotated

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.040
 or something like that to play a sound.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.720
 In fact, if you take a look in my--

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.440
 this is like a random shout out.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.880
 Take a look in my public folder, go to memes.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.040
 My MMC entry there hasn't been submitted yet.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.120
 It's right there at the bottom of the meme's folder.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.480
 It looks like a DJ deck.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.720
 It's called the-- forget what Windmill called it.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.360
 They put it on Twitter a long, long time ago.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.040
 I can't find it.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.120
 Anyway, it's in the public folder there.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.600
 It's like a DJ deck, but it's like a kid's version of that.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.480
 It's been me.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.520
 Anyway, that has some logic on it,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.600
 which enables you to do the traditional DJ scratching

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.320
 stuff.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.760
 But that is on a joint, because you

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.480
 have to spin the disk around to do DJ disk scratching.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.320
 And so take a look at that logic and how we are driving

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.600
 the playback of that disk.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.400
 That comes from an old object, which I had in my inventory,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.160
 which is just like a regular cylinder that you can scratch

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.160
 again, like a DJ, which has the bass part sound effect on it.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.040
 So I just stole that logic from there.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.960
 And then you can take a look at that.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.040
 It uses Drive playback.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.920
 By using Drive playback, you can work out

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.920
 if it's rotating, go to the speed,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.200
 if you're rotating it faster, maybe speed it up a little bit

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.240
 or stuff like that.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.680
 I think I also updated it so that if the sound isn't playing,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.720
 the audio output turns off, which is always good.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.280
 When you aren't using Play OneShot,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.440
 if the sound isn't playing, you should turn the audio output

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.280
 off wherever possible.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.780
 Jack says, do you drink tea or milk?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.680
 No.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.120
 Milk does not belong in tea.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.960
 There's like a-- where are we?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.840
 I'll try and find this.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.760
 I can't find it, but it's one of those sketch channels

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.760
 where they show someone making tea,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.840
 and then they get all aggressive because they're doing it wrong.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840
 I can't find the video.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.280
 Anyway, the point being is tea should be--

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.800
 you should be able to taste it.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.200
 The amount of times in the UK particularly where I get tea,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.720
 which is basically just milk, is really annoying.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.240
 It's really, really annoying.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.560
 Tea needs to brew.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.480
 Traditional sort of breakfast regular tea

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.960
 that you'd get if you said tea to a British person,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.680
 that doesn't need to brew for as long as you think it does.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.720
 It doesn't need a full three minutes,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.080
 but it does need some time.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.200
 Don't just show the teabag to the water.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.240
 You got to let it brew.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.800
 Green teas and stuff like that that I drink, three minutes.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.960
 I have a Google Home routine.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.840
 Tea time.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.880
 All right, three minutes, starting now.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.600
 So that's what my phone does when I say tea time to it,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.880
 because it just knows three minutes is right for tea.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.720
 Anyway, moving on to actual Nia's questions

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.240
 rather than tea questions.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.000
 Jack says, are there plans for improving

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.960
 the undo system in general?

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.800
 Yes, so the problem with the undo system is it's opt in.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.640
 So every single technical system has to opt into it.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.880
 So that's why you'll see that certain operations don't

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.160
 have undos or do have undos.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.560
 I'm going to say the word do a lot,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.840
 so if you get giggly when I say the word doo-doo,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.240
 then you're in for it, right?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 So when something needs to be undoed,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.160
 it needs to register with the undo system.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.680
 And not everything does register with the undo system,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.280
 so it can't be undone.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.440
 Additionally, some activities are just incompatible

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.600
 with the undo system.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.840
 So we are investigating that whenever we can.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.440
 As a reminder, you can also use the undo nodes yourself

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.360
 to make your tool undo compatible.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.240
 The first time I did that was a line tip.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.760
 I believe that's still in my public file drive, the tools.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.200
 It just creates lines.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.840
 That is full undo compatible, and it was a lot of effort.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.160
 The tool worked, and then I had to add undo capability to it.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.360
 And it took about as long as making the tool to then add

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.520
 undo capabilities to it.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.520
 So do keep that in mind.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.120
 If you want that in your tools, maybe start building there.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.000
 Other things like limiting the amount of undo steps,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.800
 maybe increasing the amount of undo steps,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.520
 doing sort of like undo all would be good for those times

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.320
 where something wrong just happens.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.240
 Like, whoops, I made the floor grabable,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.560
 and then someone grabbed it and turned it upside down.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.680
 It'd just be like, all right, stop, undo everything

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.320
 would be also a good feature.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.120
 Make sure you have GitHub issues in for any advancements

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.520
 to come to your system that you'd like.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.880
 Digin Bites says, isn't just hot chocolate just bean tea?

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.480
 Our chocolate's a little bit different

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.520
 because it usually has a lot more ingredients.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.840
 So the thing with coffee, or proper coffee,

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.680
 is it's just the ground up bean.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.040
 The thing with tea is it's just sort of the leaf.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.920
 And then depending on what type of leaf it is,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.600
 it's ground up leaf or full leaf tea.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.480
 Always go for full leaf tea.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.520
 I'll link my place where I get tea from in a moment.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.000
 The hot chocolate, though, is like a bunch of stuff.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.720
 Usually hot chocolate powder includes cocoa, sugar,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.440
 and powdered milk so that you just

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.280
 have to pour hot water into it.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.760
 So it's complicated.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.680
 It's almost like hot chocolate is a soup

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.600
 because there's more ingredients.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.400
 Boba tea is gross.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.640
 I'll tell you why it's gross.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.400
 And that's because I frequently end up with a clogged straw.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.040
 And then I have to suck harder.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.480
 And then the tapioca balls in Boba tea

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.680
 then shotgun into the back of my throat.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.040
 And being gross for just a second,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.800
 it feels like throwing up in reverse.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.120
 And I don't-- no, no, I don't want that.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.640
 Let's move on to the next question.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.080
 Digembite also asks, is NeosVR still using crypto,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.520
 and is it sorted with the owners?

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.800
 OK, so for that one, you can read the announcements

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.120
 channel for any updates.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.000
 Before you say there are no updates available,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.440
 I want you to read the announcements channel again,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.720
 because that's the only updates that we have for that matter.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.360
 Nothing has changed in that regard.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.760
 If something does change, it will

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.920
 be in the announcements channel before it is here.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.720
 So before you ask any other team member, including Mr. Frixius,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.960
 the announcements channel is where you want to go.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.720
 Like, I know people just go around Neos,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.440
 and they're like, I'm going to find a team member

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.280
 and ask them the Carol questions.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.960
 The answer is the same.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.400
 Nothing has changed.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.920
 Read the announcements channel.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.920
 So Jack has clarified that they want the ability

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.080
 to prevent stuff from making undos in certain situations.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.560
 Were you the person who was asking

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.760
 about doing that for gameplay-related matters?

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.080
 Because, yeah, that was an interesting one.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.640
 Basically, if it's like a--

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.440
 I don't know-- sacrifice the magic gem you've just

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.400
 got from the water temple to the god to win the game,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.600
 and then you just give it to the water god, the god goes, yay,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.720
 and then animation plays.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.800
 And then you just undo, and then you've got the crystal bag.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.920
 It's kind of like, whoops, time to cheat.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.440
 I can imagine there being a shop interface where

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.080
 I made this really cool thing.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.840
 I want to sell it to a shopkeeper,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.040
 put it on the shopkeeper's table, undo.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.520
 I got another one.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.160
 I got another one.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.800
 I've got another one.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.360
 Great, yeah, so certainly something we need to look at.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.680
 So to go make sure that there's a garbage for it.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.480
 I do like that people are thinking about games more.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.040
 Seems to happen only during MMC.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.800
 Remember that there are 12 months in the year.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.240
 For the entirety of the 12 months,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.440
 you can make games in Neos.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.400
 I love seeing them.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.040
 So I'm going to play as many of those games that

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.400
 come out in the MMC, which is going to be out soon,

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.920
 like eight days or something like that.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.160
 Moving forwards, Digium says, did Neos VR

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.800
 know Neo crypto already existed?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.240
 That's nothing to do with Neos.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.200
 There are many cryptocurrencies that

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.280
 use the sort of futuristic words in their naming.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.720
 Neos is also, I believe, a medical device manufacturer

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.960
 or something like that.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.960
 It's a bit like I used to work for the streaming site Mixer.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.520
 Mixer used to be called Beam.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.960
 And we had to change its name because we couldn't actually

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.160
 get a global trademark on Beam.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.520
 One of the reasons behind that is

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.200
 that there was a Beam telepresence robot, where

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.920
 you could remotely steer a robot around an office.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.440
 And there was also a vacuum cleaner.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.600
 It was called a Beam vacuum cleaner or something like that.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.600
 So we couldn't get the global trademark on that.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.040
 So it was very interesting.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.480
 It's nothing to do with us.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.200
 So I don't know enough about crypto,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.560
 but I know that you can't just randomly combine coins,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.020
 particularly if they're not already.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.600
 It's like saying, yo, guys, let's take United States

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.280
 dollars and Canadian dollars and merge them together

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.960
 because they're both called dollars.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.800
 That's as much sense as that question you asked, Mix.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.360
 It's just a naming thing.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.040
 There's also Australian dollars as well.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.560
 Should we combine Canadian, United States,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.360
 and Australian dollars together into a global dollar?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.720
 And before you ask, yeah, I know that's exactly what euros did.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.400
 But Europe is very weird.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.080
 There's this thing called European Union,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.080
 which makes stuff happen really fast in Europe, which

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.380
 the UK is no longer a part of.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.920
 But that's a topic for another day

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.560
 when I turn into a political commentator, which I'm not.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.580
 So I don't care to comment on it.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.560
 Digium asks, authentication via Steam support.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.560
 I'm not a fan of logging in like it's 1995.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.020
 Logging in with a username and password is actually sometimes

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.820
 the most secure operation when it comes to third parties

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.060
 holding your identity.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.180
 As a good example here, think about all the times

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.340
 where you've logged into a website with Google.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.340
 So you've gone to, I don't know, just a random website.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.680
 A common one I was seeing today because I was helping someone

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.020
 out with job applications is they

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.020
 could log into this job application website

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.300
 with their Google account.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.260
 Let's now imagine that Google goes bust,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.060
 or your Google account gets canceled for various reasons.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.260
 You now longer can actually log into that account

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.660
 because you logged in with Google,

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.260
 because you handed your authentication

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.060
 to a third party.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.340
 So I don't like the implication that logging

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.860
 in with your own username and password is old or outdated.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.660
 Hence the comment about 1995.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.100
 However, we will be looking at additional authentication

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.940
 options in the future and additionally

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.940
 looking at increasing that Remember Me,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.700
 because right now Remember Me is just a seven day rolling window.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.700
 We could maybe make that a 30 day rolling window

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.940
 or forever rolling window, depending on what we're doing.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.260
 Jack says, no, they're using sliders

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.860
 for custom directional inputs.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.860
 Basically managing the position of myself,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.140
 the ability to undo transform brings a lot of complexity

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.940
 and having to-- yeah, yeah.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.220
 It's like the same problem.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.500
 You want to prevent the undo, but for a completely different

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.700
 reason.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.860
 Drafty-- I almost called you drafty, I apologize--

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.940
 says any improvement on the deselect all bones,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.460
 so it only deselects your selection instead of deselecting

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.620
 everything, including other people's selection.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.620
 The problem with that one is actually like a data model

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.140
 thing.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.060
 It's similar to the logics interface problem,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.460
 but a little bit different.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.380
 So gizmos, which are the things that you deselect

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.340
 when you deselect all, those are generated on the host.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.020
 They're not generated on the client.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.020
 And so when you do the select all,

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.620
 we have no way currently to tell who owns what gizmo.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.500
 So what would need to be happening--

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.180
 yeah, English is strange-- for that to happen

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.940
 is that we change up the gizmo system.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.860
 So one of two things happens.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.180
 Either the gizmos register or shoulder tap each other

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.300
 to say, I was created by drafty, I was created by Jack.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.100
 And that way, we'd be able to deselect everything correctly.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.980
 Or we would have to change up the gizmos

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.620
 so that they're generated on the host, which then naturally would

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.500
 have that whole ownership thing.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.660
 Not the host, the user.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.160
 Because then the user would be like,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.660
 I have generated a gizmo host.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.860
 And the host would be like, oh, thank you

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.860
 for generating a gizmo.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.220
 I now know that you own that.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.540
 So both of those things are possible.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.500
 They just require updates to how our data model operates.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.180
 There are lots of tools.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.600
 I like the sort of radial one, which

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.060
 will delete gizmos that are within a certain radius

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.220
 of the person.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:11.720
 That's good.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.140
 Because it means if you're working

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.180
 in a corner of the map, you can deselect just stuff

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.320
 that's within a meter or two of you,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.100
 and it's usually the problem, rather than map-wide.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.020
 I have something which basically does the same as the material

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.460
 tip area mode, where I can turn a mode on the tool,

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.140
 or I can just sort of wave a collider over a gizmo

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.180
 that I don't want.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.660
 That's complicated to access.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.020
 I know that a lot of people have got this shake to deselect

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.260
 thing.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.140
 I want to move over to my tool at some point.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.060
 But I keep forgetting, so that's fine.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.820
 Digiamp says, with the whole currency thing, it's more,

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.140
 why not use an established coin rather than a new one?

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.520
 I have no idea what the motivations of the original ICO

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.160
 were.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.400
 I know that it's too late to switch to another coin.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.960
 Read announcements for information.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.080
 I think we're done talking about coins and currencies

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.880
 in crypto.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.100
 Jack asks for hardware 2FA.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.040
 Yes, there is a doobly-doo for that.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.360
 However, until we have that implemented in Neos,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.600
 did you know that you can store 2FA secrets on hardware

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.200
 security?

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.800
 What you do is you go download from your phone.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.560
 You download Yubico Authenticator.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.520
 And then what Yubico Authenticator requires

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.240
 is that you have to either plug in--

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.080
 or if you've got one of the NMCs, Yubico things,

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.640
 you can put that on the back of the phone in a C chip.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.020
 And that's the only way you can access your 2FA stuff.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.100
 I'm moving some of my 2FA to that

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.560
 because it protects you against the whole phone thing.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.300
 Most 2FA problems occur with, I got a new phone,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.320
 and I was careless when I got my new phone.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.500
 And I didn't move my 2FA over before I lost my old phone.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.440
 We get a lot of that in support.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.220
 So if you are getting a new phone, you move your 2FA first.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.880
 You can also use services like Authy,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.360
 where it will migrate your 2FA to your new phone.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.320
 I question the security of that one,

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.860
 hence why I'm moving over to Yubico-related stuff.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.080
 But then again, I've moved the problem.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.880
 Instead of, have I lost my phone or I've got a new phone,

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.280
 it's like, have I lost the YubiKey?

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.120
 So you always have a backup one.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.720
 And ideally, that backup one should

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.260
 be moved or stored offsite.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.160
 A safety deposit box at a bank would

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.520
 be the paranoid way of doing it.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.280
 Did Jim clarify, is with Auth, you still

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.620
 have access to an email, an option to recover a password?

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.680
 Yeah, that means there's two options.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.060
 You've linked your Steam account,

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.640
 or you've linked your Google account.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.280
 You can log in with that one for speed.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.020
 But you can also log in with your password

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.000
 should you lose that Google connectivity.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.800
 However, that kind of just moves the problem.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.800
 Because what the other thing you're doing there

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.800
 is you're saying, what you're really saying is,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.840
 it is easier to maintain a session on Google

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.160
 than it is to maintain a session on Neos or Steam

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.280
 than it is on Neos.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.720
 And so what you're really, really saying there,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.080
 if you look at the crux of it, is

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.160
 you're saying, I want it to be easier

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.280
 to maintain a session on Neos.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.160
 And there are a bunch of ways to do that that aren't strictly

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.640
 just Steam login.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.440
 Great.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.520
 Make sure to just refer to the announcement section.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.960
 It's like, you said things that are completely rumors,

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.200
 and I have no comment about those rumors.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.560
 Just stick to the announcements.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.880
 I just hear rumors all the time, and I'm like, none of these

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.840
 are even remotely true.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.280
 It's like, rumor, Prime has pink hair.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.800
 There you go.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.040
 There's a free rumor.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.520
 Free rumor.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.520
 Everyone's just like, hmm, I'm going to sit here and come up

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.280
 with random things that don't make any sense

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.520
 about this current situation.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.480
 And I'm like, well, if you want the actual answer

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.920
 about what's actually happening, you

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.520
 could just read the announcements channel.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.600
 People are like, no, I would rather have rumors.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.440
 I'm like, OK, fine.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.560
 I've got pink hair then.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.760
 I should complete that meme now.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.560
 I should just turn up to a random convention

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.480
 with pink hair.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.600
 Oh, here's a good question.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.040
 Thank you so much, Shadow.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.480
 Back on topic now.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.280
 Shadow has 2FA set up, but they've never

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.440
 been asked for it when logging in.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.960
 Is there supposed-- yes, there is.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.760
 So once you have 2FA enabled, 2FA

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.520
 was originally added to Neos primarily

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.160
 for NCR-related transactions.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.240
 So by default, it is not enabled for you to log in.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.440
 You can read the 2FA page on the Neos Wiki

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.240
 here, which will show you how to do it.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.200
 But if you want to be asked for your 2FA when you log in,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.480
 you can just send enable login 2FA to the Neos bot.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.120
 And then it will require your 2FA doobly-doo when you log in.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.480
 If you don't do that, it won't require it when you log in.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.200
 It is weird.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.960
 I wish it was just more clear.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.720
 But we are having a lot of difficulty

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.840
 with users not understanding the severity of 2FA.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.520
 But you know when you set up 2FA, and it's like,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.880
 save these backup codes, people just go like,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.840
 this information isn't for me.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.360
 Where's the-- what is it?

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.000
 Yeah, there we go.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.240
 This meme image, it's like, that side

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.280
 can't stop me because I can't read.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.600
 Save your backup codes.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.880
 We really do mean it.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.000
 Technically speaking, if we were following

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.120
 the letter of the law about two-factor authentication

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.960
 and two-factor security and stuff like that,

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.480
 if you lost your backup codes and your 2FA device,

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.160
 we should not recover your account.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.680
 Because we have no current way to prove that you are there.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.720
 So if you do lose that, do drop in a ticket.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.040
 We might be able to help you out.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.400
 But you need to follow the instructions.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.120
 So if any of you here have not saved your backup codes,

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.840
 please go disable 2FA using your current 2FA device.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.480
 And then re-enable 2FA and save the new backup codes

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.560
 that we give you.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.920
 Put them in a Notepad document.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.280
 Put that Notepad document on a flash drive.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.520
 Then throw that flash drive somewhere in your house

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.680
 where you know where it is.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.600
 Moving forwards, away from 2FA, Draphey says,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.680
 can we expect the ability to host headless servers

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.480
 without the need of Patreon in the future?

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.600
 That's an interesting thing because those

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.720
 are like beta features.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.320
 It's weird when we are like a beta application that's

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.960
 early access that then also has beta features.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.920
 So the Patreon thing is to reward

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.200
 people who support the product, who support Neos,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.520
 with additional features that we are testing.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.840
 And once headless servers are more standardized, better,

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.520
 smoother, easier to use, we will then

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.080
 move out of the Patreon pool and it'll become a global feature.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.160
 Of course, right now, read the announcements channel.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.000
 We aren't going to be changing anything about headless

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.120
 for the foreseeable future.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.080
 When we do, you'll be seeing that in the announcements

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.400
 channel.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.200
 Until then, yes, you'll unfortunately need the Patreon.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.880
 Having said that, though, the only thing

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.600
 that requires you to access the Patreon is that headless key.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.720
 So you can go ahead and get that headless Patreon-y doodad

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.120
 and get that headless key and do whatever you would like.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.000
 The Bumble, I think I'm reading that correctly

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.220
 with the numbers there, bouncingbises asks,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.560
 bouncing out of the game, I've been

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.720
 trying to work on a game on Neos and still new to Neos.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.200
 I saw the same issue where users can duplicate stuff.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.280
 So my work around so far has been to make a unique hash

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.240
 to an object.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.160
 If it finds the world again, auto deletes it.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.880
 So the permanent option will be awesome.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.560
 Oh, there are a couple of tagging components which

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.240
 prevent the duplicate button.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.360
 So you know the context menu that says duplicate?

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.760
 There is a way to prevent that.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.720
 And there's also a way to prevent it from being deleted.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.240
 Those, of course, don't work if someone's got an inspector

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.120
 or if they've got builder access because they could just

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.360
 duplicate it or delete it using the inspector, which

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.320
 will bypass those checks.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.560
 But if they're in a game map where you haven't given them

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.240
 builder permission and the only way that they can duplicate it

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.520
 is by using the context menu, then you can block that.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.520
 I have a video on my channel called Useful Tagging

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.240
 Components.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.760
 I believe Froppy is probably rushing to YouTube

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.800
 to get it right now.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.400
 If you won't, I'm sorry, Froppy, but I'm just preempting you.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.000
 That's usually what happens.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.700
 Either way, I'll grab it in a few minutes

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.080
 if Froppy hasn't grabbed it already.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.160
 See, Shadow says, thanks for reminding me my codes are

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.320
 on a PC I don't use anymore.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.760
 You see, you ought to think about it.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.220
 There are ways to look at security,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.400
 and it depends on your attack vector or your threat model,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.520
 et cetera, is what would happen tomorrow

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.200
 if your house set fire?

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.960
 And think about that both from a personal possessions--

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.400
 so maybe there's a photo album somewhere,

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.200
 something sentimental that you would need--

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.240
 but also from your digital identity as well.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.560
 Your house sets on fire.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.760
 You can't access any of the devices that you're on.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.520
 Maybe your phone even gets lost because the house set fire

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.900
 and you just had to run.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.280
 How difficult would it be for you to do very important

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.400
 things-- access your finances, let people know you're OK,

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.720
 organize insurance claims?

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.880
 Think about that, and then adjust your life

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.000
 if those answers aren't easy.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.360
 Moving forward to Jidget--

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.760
 [LAUGHS]

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.640
 I'm getting like halfway through office hours.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.960
 I just lose the ability to speak.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.400
 I'm just going to roll around on the floor drooling in a second.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.200
 DiginBite says, any plans to make Neos more user accessible?

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.540
 I found new installs seem to force the tutorial to escape.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.280
 That's actually our plan to make it more accessible,

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.200
 which is a weird problem that we have.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.680
 We are finding, just generally, that it's

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.360
 very difficult to tutor people who

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.720
 have different expectations of what a tutorial should be.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.840
 So some users come in and they don't know VR.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.820
 So they need to be shown their controllers

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.980
 and like, this is a button.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.320
 This is how you push the button.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.480
 This is what the button does.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.180
 Some people come in and they're rushing

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.700
 because they're trying to meet up with their friends.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.880
 They're like, I don't care about this tutorial.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.280
 I don't want to read it because I'm

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.000
 rushing to meet up with my friend

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.720
 and chill out and hang out.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.880
 And some people come in and they're experts.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.340
 And they're like, I know everything.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.600
 And I don't want to be taught.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.680
 I know everything.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.080
 I know that you're telling me that I don't,

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.920
 but I know everything.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.840
 Get out of my way.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.000
 And so we're trying to find a way that sort of level

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.760
 sets that.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.380
 And the only thing that we found so far that to do that

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.560
 is to actually force you to go through the tutorial.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.080
 Because those who know what they're doing

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.380
 can just spam through it.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.680
 Those who don't know what they're doing

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.280
 will usually follow the tutorial.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.680
 And those that are really, really annoyed that you're

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.800
 forced through the tutorial will add skip intro tutorial

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.600
 as a command line argument to the shortcut

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.920
 they use to run the game.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.240
 I'm one of those guys.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.560
 So I never see the tutorial.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.800
 It's an interesting problem.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.800
 We're trying to solve it.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.680
 We've got-- we want to do more MTC updates to make

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.280
 that experience better.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.600
 It is what we've got, though.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.440
 I don't think it's the problem that's making

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.560
 Neos not user accessible.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.840
 I think that problem actually occurs when it happens,

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.040
 is when you go past that tutorial.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.840
 We then don't follow up with additional tutorials

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.200
 or additional information or additional documentation

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.240
 inside the game.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.280
 All of it's outside, or you have to ask someone

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.840
 which is effectively outside.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.440
 Moving forwards.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.720
 If you lose your backup code, you

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.680
 need to prove your identity by beating Prime in a chess match.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.920
 That'd actually be quite easy.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.720
 I'm not that good at chess.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.920
 Random side note here.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.720
 I was exploring VR chat worlds many years ago.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.120
 And a world came up in the world's browser

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.040
 called Daddy's Chess Dungeon.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.720
 And I'm like, what is this?

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.120
 This sounds risky.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.680
 This sounds like maybe I need to be at a private session

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.960
 to go into this world.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.560
 No, it was literally just a dark room with a chess board in it

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.280
 made by a guy called Daddy.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.640
 So it sounded rude, but it wasn't at all.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.520
 It was just a chess board in a dark room.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.240
 That was funny.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.040
 The associations we have of various words and concepts

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.840
 lead you down a different path.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.680
 Stifle linked to the useful tagging components.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.600
 Great.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.000
 Digium says, how about a menu dialogue option for skip

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.400
 tutorial basics in advance?

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.520
 We have discussed having a skip tutorial button.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.240
 The problem is that people that need the tutorial

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.040
 would push it.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.040
 People don't want to learn sometimes.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.560
 And sometimes you have to sort of guide them and force them

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.320
 to learn.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.040
 It is a problem.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.440
 I do agree that it could be better.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.840
 And the content team are looking at that

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.160
 and trying to make that better as they go.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.920
 Any feedback that you have would be great.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.080
 I think there's some issues for it.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.200
 I also think there was an issue where we discussed the skip

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:28.960
 button.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.740
 And that's where you can read the historical conversation

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.440
 about why that doesn't exist.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.280
 If you struggle with the tutorial at a later point

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.560
 and you're frustrated by it, if the cage is up at the MTC,

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.680
 just spam the next button.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.280
 It'll go down.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.920
 You don't have to do anything on the screen.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.960
 But you see, that's a problem now.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.040
 Because now I'm going to tell you that.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.120
 And you're going to tell other people.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.960
 And then no one's going to read the tutorial.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.960
 And then no one learns.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.020
 So you see, it's like a chicken and egg problem.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.440
 It's like we want people to learn.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.520
 But people don't like the way that we're teaching them.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.440
 So they're going to skip it.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.440
 So they can't learn.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.440
 So we need to improve it.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.520
 But we don't know how to improve it

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.720
 without forcing them to learn.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.200
 It's difficult.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.680
 Jack says, looking forward to exploring the MSC entries,

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.280
 by the way.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.040
 Yep, I am.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.720
 Immediate thing I have to do once the MSC entry closes

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.300
 is go test the voting system, though,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.060
 because that's my responsibility.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.780
 The Bumble says, is there a tutorial on gesture shortcuts?

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.360
 I think there's something somewhere that does them.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.020
 I'm not sure if it's in the MTC.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.420
 But there certainly is something.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.220
 Why is my phone--

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.660
 like, hello, phone?

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.540
 The screen just turned on and was like, hello.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.380
 And I'm like, is that a call?

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.220
 That usually means a call.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.060
 But it wasn't a call.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.020
 Very confused.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.520
 Yeah, if you go back to the MTC, I think part of the problem

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.140
 is actually us calling it MTC.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.100
 It's meant to be the metaverse training center.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.380
 But if it was actually called tutorial, click here.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.180
 Or maybe put a neon sign around it,

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.820
 like tutorials with a big arrow.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.300
 It might be easier to find it.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.920
 Something I think we need to do a lot,

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.780
 and I think that will actually help a lot,

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.380
 but we need to find out where we do it,

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.340
 is when you change worlds in VRChat,

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.900
 they display little announcements to you

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.980
 whilst it's loading.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.020
 The world is loading.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.220
 And it says, remember, these things are against the rules.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.740
 You can report rules with the Report button.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.420
 Or it says, here's how to do this thing.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.580
 And you might not read them because you've

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.740
 seen them so much, or maybe you're an expert.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.260
 But the information is still there.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.620
 And you still process them a little bit.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.040
 So it still reinforces that in your head.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.100
 And it gives them an opportunity to do updates and announcements

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:19.620
 there.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.900
 Maybe their rules change, they could put an announcement

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.520
 there.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.860
 So we certainly need something like that somewhere.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.620
 I don't know where.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.500
 I like the fact that you can load into a world

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.940
 and have a loading screen.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.620
 We need somewhere to put little messages like that, though.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.380
 Robbie says, have the loading tips been narrated by Audiobook

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:37.900
 Prime?

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.300
 It is a common thing as well.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.860
 I seem to remember the first game I remembered seeing it on

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.420
 was Fallout 3 or something.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.780
 I'm not sure if that's the first game that actually did it.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.540
 It's the first one I remember.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.560
 I'd got an Xbox.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.700
 I put in Fallout 3.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.480
 And I'd loaded it.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.340
 And it was like, I don't know, because I don't remember much

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:54.860
 of Fallout.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.420
 But like, rockets are good at exploding things,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.880
 would be like a loading screen tip.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.460
 But you're like, got it.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.980
 Understood.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.340
 Understand that rockets are good at exploding things.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.980
 Gray Foxen asks, can I help you try and break the voting system?

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.060
 Nope.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.660
 We've tested it sufficiently to know that it is OK.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.900
 It is not foolproof.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.540
 So I have to watch it like a hawk.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.140
 And I also have a 10-step validation process

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.780
 that happens once voting closes to validate each vote.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.340
 So it's fun.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.220
 There's a huge problem with electronic voting.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.940
 It's basically just fraught with error.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.620
 You can find information about that on a Tom Scott video,

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.900
 which I've got linked somewhere.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.740
 So I have to be really careful and take a look at it.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.860
 I also use pivot tables.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.580
 Does anyone know what a pivot table is?

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.900
 I take the output, which is a CSV,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.700
 and then I put it into like a--

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.620
 not that one.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.060
 That's the wrong video.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.780
 But it's OK.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.820
 That's a good video for the voting system.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.780
 Here's the right video.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.860
 There we go.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.860
 But yeah, I take the output as a CSV, convert it to Excel,

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.020
 and then I use a pivot table.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.820
 Pivot tables are amazing.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.460
 All right, we are at time.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.180
 So if anyone's typing any questions, go for it.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.460
 But take a look.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.900
 Make sure I'm not missing any additional questions.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.100
 If anyone's typing a question, go for it.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.100
 But we'll cut off questions that people are typing very soon.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.460
 I'll get those in.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.860
 We'll keep that in mind.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.620
 Jackal says that if they need a voice for stuff like loading

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.980
 screens, I'll do it for free.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.100
 We'll keep that in mind.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.660
 It's an interesting take, because I

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.140
 was looking at the locale files, and we

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.660
 need to go back through anyone that's contributed to the locale

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.220
 and get them to sign some paperwork at some point.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.380
 It's going to be interesting.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.100
 It's basically like we don't technically

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.900
 own the contributions.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.860
 We don't have a license to their contribution,

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.860
 so it's a bit weird.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.140
 We need to go back and do that.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.500
 Contributed license agreement or something like that

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.580
 is usually what we need.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.820
 We need to go back and do that.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.340
 But that only matters once we start

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.420
 putting from locale again.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.220
 So I'll sort it out eventually.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.940
 I remember every year, someone ends up managing

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.260
 to break one of the booths.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.020
 The way it works is we've got 10 booths, five on the left

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.060
 and five on the right.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.700
 And I always have to put red tape,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.260
 caution tape or closed tape over one of the booths,

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.500
 because someone always ends up managing to break one of them.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.700
 And then what I do is I look for--

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.500
 oh, look, there's no one voting right now.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.660
 I can quickly restart the world.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.220
 And that will kick one of the broken voting booths

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.100
 back into there.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.340
 I do have the idle restart on, but sometimes I

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.980
 just want to make it work again so that I can figure it out

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.100
 in a way that makes it make sense.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.620
 With that, I think we're at the end.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.660
 If you have any additional questions,

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.260
 please feel free to direct message me,

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.740
 drop it in the questions and help channel,

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.900
 send me carrier pigeons, whatever you want to do.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.980
 Smoke signals, I don't know, lasers, moss code,

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.980
 whatever you want to do.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.300
 I'm happy to help you out.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.620
 Good luck with your MMC entries.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.540
 Do you remember to submit the world early?

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.820
 I'm going to tell you again, submit the world early.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.660
 You don't need to wait till the world is finished before you

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.980
 put it on that submission plate.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.020
 And for the last day of the MMC, you

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.060
 shouldn't be making edits.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.260
 You should be testing.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.660
 What happens for desktop users?

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.340
 What happens for more than one user?

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.700
 Can this be broken?

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.020
 What happens for users that may be a color blind?

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.540
 What happens for users who are deaf?

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.060
 What happens for users who are blind?

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.380
 Well, blind's like a strange one.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.020
 Partially sighted would be a better term.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.340
 Visually impaired, whatever phrasing you want to use there.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.980
 And I will speak to you again soon.
