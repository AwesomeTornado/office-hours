WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Okay, welcome to Prime Time, it is 4pm, so we're going to go ahead and get started.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.120
Please drop your questions in the Office Hours text channel if you have questions, and I'll

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.920
get to them as soon as I can.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.240
There are no questions waiting, so whilst we're waiting for that, I do want to promote

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.080
the newly created-from-myself myths page.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.720
We're a little bit agitated by just myths in the community.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.080
It's kind of natural right now due to the situations at play, but hey, that's a Tico

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.080
link.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.160
It's a natural link, I copied it from my Twitter, that's why it's a Tico link, give me a second,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160
there we go.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
My myths page.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.680
Those of you who drop in, if you have any questions, drop them into the Office Hours

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.800
text channel, it's two slots above this one in the channel list, I'll just hang out and

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.360
we'll wait for any questions that make, if at all.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.360
Please ask questions.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.680
In case we have a question from Drace, which is why are you so amazing, the answer to that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.960
one is that is an opinion, which you are welcome to have, there is no way to justify an opinion.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.960
It's your opinion.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.720
For those new folks dropping in, drop questions in Office Hours and we'll get to them as soon

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.480
as we can, otherwise just sit back, relax, and listen to the uncomfortable silence that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.560
exists in this room when there are no questions.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.920
For those dropping in, drop questions in Office Hours, the text channel, it's two slots above

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.280
this one that you clicked, and we'll get to them as soon as we can, there are still no

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.680
questions.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.760
So the uncomfortable silence will be increased to level 11.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.920
We have a good question from SnakeFinnis who asks what is this?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.240
So this is the Office Hours or AMA for Primetime, which is myself.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.160
I'm in charge of sort of many things, but most importantly documentation and tutorials

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.560
here at Neos, so if you have questions on those lines, let me know.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.000
If you have questions just for the Neos team generally, ask them, I'll be able to sort

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.360
of either answer them or redirect you to the appropriate place.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.800
Whatever you want to ask, you can go ahead and ask, just drop it in the Office Hours

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800
channel.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.200
That's a good question, says are there any guidelines for formatting Neos Wiki pages?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
The answer is yes.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.360
On the sidebar of the Neos Wiki, there is a button called contributing to the Wiki,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.280
which leads to a page which talks about the formatting and guidance for how to contribute

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280
to the Wiki.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280
Good.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280
We have some questions.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.480
So from Trace, we say how are you doing yourself on this fine day?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480
I'm good.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480
I saw a bird.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.880
I thought it was yesterday, but I guess I'm going to talk about it.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.040
Yeah, I've got a balcony here in my apartment, and a bird landed on the chair outside here

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.360
and looked at me grumpily and then ruffled his feathers and flew away.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.140
That was cool.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.000
So where does the money from Patreon go to?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.760
So the money from Patreon goes into an account, and then that account is used to pay for various

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
things.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.120
Right now that would be the cloud bill that we have, so we have cloud services.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.920
Those do require money, and any other sort of technical stuff like that.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.160
So I presume we'd have to renew our domain periodically.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.000
So Neos.com is searching needs renewing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
That will get paid for.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.600
Other than that, I don't actually know.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.320
I'd love for us to get to pie chart.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.320
Pie chart would be great.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.060
It would be like I'm making up these percentages.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.880
These are not the correct percentages.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.320
I'm just making them up for conversation.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.960
Let's say 10% goes to service costs.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.880
2% goes to, I don't know, the administrative costs, like whatever domain renewal, I don't

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.880
know.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.880
Just like stuff like that.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.320
It would be like two thirds goes to salaries or whatever, and it would be like 1% goes

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.320
to cheese.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.800
You know, like a pie chart that shows exactly where the money was going would be like amazing.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.680
You'd be able to apply that pie chart to your individual contribution.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.320
Let's say, for example, you contributed $100 a month, then you'd be able to do that quite

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.320
easily.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.120
You'd be able to be like, ah, 1%, that's $1, goes towards prime's cheese collection.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.400
You'd be able to be like, yep, $1 of my money goes to prime's cheese collection, and you'd

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400
be beautiful.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.480
So hopefully maybe that in the future.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.640
We'd probably sort of extrapolate those out over a year as well, which sometimes isn't

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.640
done.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.760
Sometimes you'll see pie charts which are just like the month.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.740
That means what you get is like spikes and randomness.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.320
Whereas if you take those yearly expenses, break them down monthly, then you can get

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.960
like a pie chart that's a lot more stable.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.840
So Daffy has a question.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.880
For people who might want to start making things utilizing resources outside of Neos

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.600
to contribute to it, has anybody thought of developing a workflow tutorials to help generate

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.800
assets or encourage user-created content inside of Neos, i.e., a blend of the substance to

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800
an important game?

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800
Not that I'm aware of.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.840
It's certainly like an avenue that people can certainly go into.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.080
I know that we've got a couple of sort of pin resources around for things like what

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.720
substance painter workflow to use, what materials, what textures to use.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.480
We've also got Wiki pages starting to appear, like the humanoid requirements I completely

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.560
rewrote because it was driving me mad.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.480
We constantly get queries about that.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.360
They're like, my hip bone is called orangutan, and Neos isn't recognizing it as an avatar.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.880
Like, it should be fixed.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.920
I'm like, no, it shouldn't.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.840
Don't name your hip bone orangutan.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.440
Name it hip, or hips, or hips, lowercase, or hip, lowercase, fine, it'll pick it up.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.400
If it's a hip bone, it should be named hips.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.480
But yeah, certainly like modeling and stuff like that.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.400
We often get feedback on our PBS, like, metallic maps that people find confusing, which is

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.920
confusing to me because it's the standard Unity material map, so I don't really know

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920
what's going on there.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.440
Maybe it's an unreal thing, who knows?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.840
As always, just make tutorials.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.640
Make them, share them, people will watch them.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.880
If I was confident in my 3D modeling ability enough to make a functional avatar, we're

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.480
talking just like a blob person, you know, like, tubes for legs, et cetera, I would do

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.480
the entire process.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.600
I'd be like, all right, day one, wake one, open blender, make the tube man, export to

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.900
FBX, import, put the head where the head is, the hand where the hand is, look, I'm using

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.680
them, just to sort of show it isn't hard.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.920
The hard part should just be in the creativity.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.720
It shouldn't be in the technicalities, it should always be the same.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.840
Yeah, the skin modifier, yep, that would be, you know, perfect.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.640
There's a variation there, like the one on the bottom right, sort of reminiscent of sort

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.080
of Incredibles or Minions styling.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.720
You make like an armature, and then you do the skin modifier on it.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.040
You do the armature like just lines.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.760
When I say armature, I don't mean blending armature, I mean like how you do an armature

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.380
if you're sculpting IRL, you take wire, sometimes metal coat hangers, you bend it into the shape

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.580
of the body, then you throw clay on it, and that's exactly what the skin modifier does.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.160
You make the bent coat hanger, and then you throw the skin modifier on it, and you get

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.160
clay.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.600
Duff asks, have you seen other user workflows utilizing resources outside of blended substance?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.120
If so, what would alternative programs be?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.520
People do still use the other 3D modelers, Maya, and then like other more obscure ones.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.000
Maya and Blender are usually the two that people use these days.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.880
I've also seen a lot of people that use ZBrush for sculpting.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.880
That's totally fine, too.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.960
ZBrush, ZBrush, American, UK pronunciations.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.960
Fusion comes up as well.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.920
I forgot, like when it comes to hard service modeling, some people use like fusion stuff

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.080
like that, SketchUp, that one for like architectural modeling.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.600
There's one particular user who was using the hammer editor to make their map for everyone

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600
to see.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600
That was fun as well.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.480
But yeah, it's basically like the assets there are very similar to the ones that you would

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.800
use for any game, really.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.160
I wouldn't like discourage or discount, is probably a better wording there, the use of

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.920
anything like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.net, anything like that.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.760
You just sometimes like, a good example here being like you download an avatar base and

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.520
it has brown eyes and you want blue eyes, Photoshop or whatever can fix that for you.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.860
There's no need to open Blender.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.580
There's no need to open Substance Painter.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.400
There's no real need to even understand how the avatar works, right?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.940
You just open up the texture file and you're like, there are the eyes, I'll make them blue.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.040
And then you make them blue.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.680
I'm sort of interested, but not really because the Windows UI is unfortunately, it wasn't

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.880
good the last time I looked at it.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.960
It might be good now.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.240
There's this program called Dust, Dust 3D, which is a completely different way of modeling

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.320
than you have seen.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:13.120
It's like hard to explain, but you have to get a side and front photo of the same object

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.560
and then you can kind of just like model it.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.320
Oh, that's going to be the recording there, I just started a YouTube video.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.600
If you hear piano music on the recording of this, just ignore it.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:28.880
But yeah, if you look at this video here, they model a dog and it isn't in any way that

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.800
you would imagine that you would model a dog.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.240
They'd never edit vertices at all.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.640
It might look like they do, but they never do.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.720
For maps and worlds like that, I have a lessons to World Machine.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720
I haven't used it.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.000
World Machine usually makes worlds which are too big for Nius.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.420
There is another one that generates terrain.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.240
Just do that easily with Blender and Photoshop as well.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240
You just make terrain.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.240
It's easy.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.440
It's just like a grayscale height map.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.920
Maps and worlds, just sometimes like paper will actually help there.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.080
Just throw stuff around.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:06.080
I did see a video yesterday of the PS5 game or PlayStation game called Dreams, where you

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.120
can...

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:14.240
It's very much sort of like more simplified than Nius, of course, but very much more user-friendly

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.720
where you can just sort of throw around stuff and people are like making art there or making

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.240
scenes there that allow them to just explore what they're doing.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.720
I know a lot of people use that for sort of sharing ideas and then they'll go ahead and

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.640
build it once they know what the ideas look like.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.960
Moving on to other questions there.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.760
Let's ask what happens to the games' office hours.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.760
I don't know.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.760
I've asked them a few times.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:41.800
I moved their office hours to like temporarily suspended along with Chroma's.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.880
I would presume you would have to ask them if you want more information about that.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.640
Russia asks, is there anything you've been wanting to cover in a tutorial but haven't

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.960
got around to or would like to see more tutorials on?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.960
I have a huge list I just haven't got around to, so I'll just skip that one with everything

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.400
jazz hands.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.800
I would like to see more tutorials on basically anything.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.400
Sometimes people are like, oh, I won't make tutorials because Prime makes them.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400
You go ahead and make them.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.920
Go ahead and make them.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.360
Basement Nerds Logix tutorial isn't like my style.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.920
It's made completely differently.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.760
I myself wouldn't find it effective to learn Logix, but some people do and they find it

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.240
helpful and that's great.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.360
That really just highlights that everyone learns differently and has a different approach

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.260
to both learning and teaching.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.480
So go for it.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.480
Like make tutorials.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.520
If there were like, I don't know, 50 tutorials for learning Logix out there, then there is

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.120
a greater chance that one would fit a particular user.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.280
Additionally, there is this abbreviation called FAST or FASTER if you want to be more modern

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.600
in the sort of lingo for it, which is about learning things.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.840
There's a blog article about it, learning and I think FASTER, and it just has an abbreviation

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.840
and I think the T is like teach.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.120
Yeah, the T is teach.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.560
So there's a way of like, there's also like a pyramid of learning, I never remember what

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.560
it's called.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560
Yeah, here it is.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:07.200
I don't know if this is like the exact one, but it promotes the different types of learning

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:16.920
and it shows here that like lectures, audiovisual stuff is 20% retained and then doing it, which

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.960
is the sort of lower half of that pyramid, is 30, 50%, 75% and then teaching others right

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.960
at the bottom, 90%.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:31.080
I was talking to Fruchs a while ago and there is a study that was portrayed in I think it

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.800
was a European country.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.520
He recommended a book about it, but I forgot the name of the book, where they created a

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.200
new type of school and in this type of school there was no real structure to it.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.820
People were just like free to learn whatever and I didn't understand it, I was like what

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.880
do you mean?

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:51.440
What happened was they mixed the age groups of the students, just sort of freeform really,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.080
and they taught each other mostly.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.720
So there might be like in the school like a reading room or a reading corner of a room

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.480
and there might be an older student there reading a more complex book and it'll be a

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.680
cool story and so a younger student would go over there and sit down and be like sounds

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.160
cool read me the story and then they would read the story to them and then maybe they

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.920
might go I want to know what happens next can you teach me how to read a book at this

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.480
level and then boom you've got an older student learning to read by teaching a younger student

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.520
how to read who's learning how to read and then that just happened everywhere you know

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.160
maybe the kid likes dinosaurs so he goes over to like a freeform library and goes cool pulls

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.060
a book on dinosaurs can't read it but can look at the pictures looks at the pictures

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.040
shows the pictures to his classmates and they're like cool we would like to learn how to read

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.120
this dinosaur book over to an older student all sorts of stuff like that that's probably

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.680
the name ng says it's a Sudbury school probably I need to read the book to understand more

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.000
about how that works because I've got sort of questions about sort of base skills I don't

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.440
think would be taught effectively there like let's say a kid goes into that environment

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.240
and they want to make a game cool like they'll need to learn some maths there but I believe

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.800
there's probably a path through that school where they don't learn more traditionalized

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.240
stuff but part of the argument behind that type of schooling is do they need to and that

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.720
goes against the sort of whole like up and arm stand on your soapbox land of standardized

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.640
testing is bad which generally I agree on but like I'm I'm biased because I've been

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.940
through education so like whatever it's a good thought experiment the point there being

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.120
though is that you'll learn better by teaching people and you'll learn better by interacting

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:34.640
with people whilst you are teaching and also by just doing and making tutorials is a fantastic

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:41.360
example of that so try that just googled to ng use Sudbury school and yes there is a wiki

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.280
learning and teaching people also comes up with like new new scenarios new things that

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:54.000
you might not have you know wanted to know how to do so with my work with Hamish University

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.740
of Sydney and now whatever university they're working with there's just like crazy stuff

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.840
that comes up that just doesn't make any sense but you're like cool like it's time we came

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.640
to me and he's like hey I need to calculate the angular velocity of your eyeball just

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:13.080
like okay okay sure we can do that we can calculate the angular velocity of an eyeball

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:19.000
and so we used the eye tracking data to figure that out it's useful I can't remember exactly

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.340
how that's one of the problems you're like okay I'll do this crazy thing but like why

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.960
are we doing it and you kind of forget sometimes it is something to do with the stuff there

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:33.400
their phd was on which is a test that involves eye movement to head movement synchronization

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.420
which can diagnose vestibular issues vestibular issues is the sort of organ and system that's

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.120
in the middle ear that drives your balance and when it's broken you can do what's called

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:49.760
a hit test which sort of figures out if there is a problem there you do that by measuring

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.600
the eye movement in relation to a head movement after you rapidly jerk their head towards

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.820
one direction almost like you're kind of breaking their neck in a sort of cinemagraphic way

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.000
like you might see in a movie but not actually breaking their neck of course because that

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.240
would never go through like ethics so doing that in in game is what we were trying by

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.800
measuring the velocity of the eyeball moving on to the next question here lazy hat guys

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.640
is any atas on the next major update to nears no I don't have any atas we don't usually

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.360
provide them I would love to provide them in the future we just can't provide them right

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:27.600
now check the roadmap check our discord announcements channel and check our steam update feed I

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.680
guess and it'll come eventually there is one sub preschool in the entirety of the UK okay

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.280
well I had zero chance of going to that then where is it oh it's in Margate I know Margate

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.680
Margate's a coastal town I'd usually go there to go to the beach that's a good good good

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:48.560
good question from crusher here so crusher says how would you go about starting large

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:56.360
projects nears or elsewhere I am traditionally now I don't really want to be but hey careers

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:03.200
are fun I am actually a product manager right now and so I am very educated in this area

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.920
but there are parallels where you can sort of scheme off the top is what I'm saying if

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.000
you go deep into project management you're wasting your time planning and communication

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.360
is so important I would love if we just had in the education science channel we just had

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.240
a sort of recording from a couple of people from the MC 2022 where they talked about sort

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.900
of how they built things I would love to get that from a particular group I'd like to see

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:38.200
it from the credit canyon group and in particular from their last year's entry the same group

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:44.960
did the abandonware last year and I know abandonware that we had just forgotten their name for

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.640
no reason com dog com dog was just like running around managing the project and making sure

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.800
everyone did stuff and that's because they knew what they wanted to do and they did it

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.960
I've seen a lot of people that just like you know you go into nears and you're like cool

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.520
I can throw this around I can throw it everywhere I can do whatever I want but then they never

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.680
finish it because they don't really have a plan they don't know what they're doing I

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.760
also get sort of comments about sort of oh I don't use dynamic variables I don't use

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.920
dynamic impulses because I can never remember what I've called them and the answer there

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:18.080
is like well plan and document your project then if you are making a shooter in nears

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.220
and you're using dynamic variables for that shooter write a text document in notepad which

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:28.120
lists the dynamic variable player health or player ammo or whatever you want to use save

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.960
it in there's a dot text bring it into the world save it to the world till it's complete

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.240
and then everyone in that world can just float over to that text document and be like oh

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.800
yeah it's player health I can use that great but if you don't do that then it's gonna lead

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.080
to problems particularly if you have multiple people working on the project you need to

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.640
know what you need to do I don't want you to stop and do the whole sort of like let's

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.400
plan for three months and then not do anything but just like stopping and realizing that

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.800
you need to converse or talk about things will get you a long way there I highly do

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:06.520
not recommend scrum but like there's about 15,000 methodologies scrum I've never seen

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:14.640
done correctly though I am a certified scrum master but I don't put that on my resume anywhere

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.760
it's just a word I'd like to show you an amazing document from the Department of Defense this

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:26.240
is the United States Department of Defense and it's called spotting agile bullshit or

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.520
something along those lines it's a really scary link because it's like literally the

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.840
Department of Defense but I promise you it's fine it's just a PDF detecting agile BS it's

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.640
great and they talk about how like it's a buzzword they talk about everything and then

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.060
they go all the way down to the bottom and there's like a great graphic on page five

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:53.240
page five is like more suited to larger more long-term projects rather than you know say

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:59.880
for example a month-long project for the MMC or you know a smaller NEOS project the graphical

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:05.520
version on page five would be great for looking and modeling for example NEOS itself or modeling

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.640
any other VR platform itself it's like one of the things on the graphical things is our

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.400
teams delivering working software to real users every iteration and gathering feedback

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:22.480
yes then it's actually agile otherwise no it's it's not and we were doing that I mean

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.320
I'm just sort of skip over what's going on right now in the announcements channel etc

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.920
we were doing that right we were like updates came in we might not necessarily be able to

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.400
work on exactly what you guys wanted us to work on but like it was someone would be like

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.320
I'm having trouble doing this and freaks ago here's a new logics note and you get it so

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:48.200
cool so just think of that and think of stuff like that back at university we had to do

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.560
a final project which is worth like I don't know like 60% of my degree and I nailed it

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.900
I was amazing at it and the project methodology I used for there was fake it till you make

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:05.400
it but I had to do like 14 pages of a like a paper etc on evaluating the different methodologies

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.480
and scrum like hit the bottom of the list for some reason so moving on because we're

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:20.880
running long time mr. Angie asked if we had any exciting things so this is this is for

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.880
use in jaw reconstructive surgery where if we are reconstructing someone's jaw we can

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.080
actually use the leg bone I don't know why it's decided that we you know there's there's

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.040
many bones between the leg and the jaw but apparently the leg bone is the more suit most

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.240
suitable bone and what the doctors want to say is what like section of bone can they

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:47.120
cut and then what would that do to the jaw so there's a little rig where we're slicing

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.840
the leg bone twice we're using a larger model for slicing it and that would then be placed

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.840
near the jaw but then we're also reflecting that slicing on the actual leg bone so they

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.780
can check that they haven't taken too much leg bone because the user ideally still needs

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:06.000
to be able to although usually they are in crutches or have reduced mobility but they

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.080
have a jaw again that's kind of more important sometimes so let's hop through the rest of

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.440
the questions trace asks when creating a world near say a project that is going to be a game

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.780
world that is publicly playable how far can you go into the terms of using ripped assets

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.540
or sound from other games or movies before it dips into the toes of legal valley please

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:29.040
read our terms of use and our guidelines before you do that there is the concept of fair use

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.720
facebook fair use is often misunderstood for an appropriate terminology or look at that

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.240
you would need to contact a lawyer i would advise just not using ripped assets at all

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.720
because then you don't need to contact a lawyer and lawyers are expensive if you would like

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.120
to use ripped assets you are stealing stuff unless you can justify it under free use fair

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:53.280
use so check our guidelines check the terms of service read up on fair use contact a lawyer

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.600
if they say you can use it you can use it and if they say you can't you can't or just

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.160
avoid all that complexity and just don't use ripped assets it's very simple so ng is i'm

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:08.640
asking um what methods i've seen that work uh work with a similar philosophy um to be

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:15.760
honest i've never seen any development methodology it's scrum fdd which is feature-driven development

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.080
traditional agile traditional waterfall all the others that have various names i've forgotten

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.140
now i've never seen any of them work and the reason is that like you need to build your

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:29.040
own and you need to build your own from the community of people i say community because

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.760
like when you'll get a large enough team it's less a team it's more like a community of

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.640
people and seeing what they want to do a good example there is things like story points

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.940
where um i have frequent arguments at work about if story points are days and the answer

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.240
is no story points are not days story points are a measure of difficulty and then you can

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.600
track story points based on how many you can complete during iteration i need you to find

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.400
some terms here we're running over but i'm going to do it because it's a good interesting

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:01.140
conversation um if you are planning the next two weeks of a a team uh you know software

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.800
development team you would call that an iteration sometimes a sprint doesn't really matter i

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.120
never call them sprints because sprints implies moving fast and that's bad um well moving

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.560
fast is good but like moving fast sprinting means like over exertion that's why i don't

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.040
use it and so what you're trying to do is plan how much work can we do over the next

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.160
iteration how much work can we do over the next two weeks and it used to be historically

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.500
that that would be defined way ahead of time in project planning which occurred before

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.840
anyone picked up their pencils and started making stuff but now it's planned sort of

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:38.000
as you go and you might say hey i think we can do two of these really big things for

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.840
the next iteration but then you kind of get fuzzy on that it's like well how big are they

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.720
how much are they going to take and so you try and estimate how long they're going to

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.120
take and then there are schools of thought about estimating in days you're like oh well

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.840
this would take five days and this would take five days and you're like boom that's an entire

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.200
iteration of work two weeks was 14 days four days for sort of wiggle room cool you've managed

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:04.840
to schedule two features but days are not useful um if you're using the story points

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.440
a story in agile development is kind of like a unit of work which benefits the user it's

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.040
hard to explain um so instead story points should be the difficulty because the difficulty

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.360
means that you have more of a range to play with with a two-week iteration you have 14

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.800
days whereas with story points you can go anywhere from 0 to 99 and then you know what's

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.200
going on and you can track it and figure out how much your team can do so as an example

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.920
here you might say hey this really big feature that is 50 story points and hey this other

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.720
feature that is five story points historically how many story points have we got through

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.980
in this particular iteration over the course of the last year historically we've managed

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:48.000
to do 40 story points well great you can't do that 50 story point activity but you can

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.800
do that five one and it lets you plan a little bit better but because it's a community of

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.880
people working i'm like oh you've given story points to my items as days again haven't you

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.040
colleague and they're like yes okay sad face and then we have to work around that and then

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.320
like the hierarchy of course we want to do work tracking and doing well tracking at work

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.720
especially this company of my scale is just crazy people are like oh yeah but i need to

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.960
put this under this and that under that and this under that and just no okay two more

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:23.280
questions uh hack 13 asks i used nested sessions this past weekend however i struggle to see

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.000
the benefits of the use of the page for them also seems to not exist you provide context

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.880
in the use case yes hotel rooms um so they're used a lot and they're actually created for

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:38.880
the vblfc and the reason behind that is let's say you have a lobby of a hotel or the lobby

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.640
of a convention that's where people sign up they get their badge and then they disappear

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.800
um the disappearing act we wanted that to be other worlds so if you went to the pool

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.560
you'd go to the pool world i remember the vblfc pool world well or if you want to disappear

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.540
the hotel rooms you go to the hotel rooms world but what that does it starts to show

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.160
a unrealistic expectation of the number of people who are at the convention because they're

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.960
all in different worlds and they're all spread out if you use the nested session feature

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.880
you can group all those sessions together into like a whole hotel and so it doesn't

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.720
matter what part of the hotel they're in they're counted together and anyone new who wants

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.480
to join can go either straight to the session that people are in via the friends list or

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.640
to the entrance of the hotel where they can then find signposts to other sessions that

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:28.360
have been there there's a bit of a like problem in the naming of that feature because um nested

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:34.020
sessions also comes up in code uh when it comes up to the if you remember the like the

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.940
like uh the ball menu that's on your right hand where you can sort of see which world

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.580
and then when you close out worlds you'll close out worlds in a certain order that's

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.180
also called nesting and so i want to kind of like drop the terminology there between

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:52.820
the two features um try and make those a bit clearer and then document them um honestly

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:58.120
if you're not doing a sort of convention or a hotel style event or like a a big collection

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.880
of people style event you don't need to use it and even sometimes when you are doing a

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.320
big event you don't need to use it that's a good example there for the mmc award party

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.720
the award ceremony we we didn't have nested sessions going there because it was different

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.480
watch parties it was oh here's the critic canyon watch party here's the i remember because

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.440
it was a while ago but you know here's the other social world that's doing a watch party

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.120
here's the other social world that's doing a watch party you didn't need that to be nested

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:30.400
because it was distinct activities but um conventions i believe um for uh fernal i keep

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.920
saying funeral equinox i had that whole problem throughout the event uh psycho asked about

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:41.080
the ball menu if it's legacy it is legacy but the systems that play uh weren't and are

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.320
not and will not be removed you'll notice that even if you use my worlds are in facet

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:50.760
if you close out worlds you'll still end up closing out them in a like structured way

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.720
and that still matches what the balls would render if you had the balls on but yeah the

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.960
balls are legacy you can quote me on that one damn it the balls are legacy so dre says

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.440
now i'm curious what's more expensive um to hire a musical sound designer or pay a lawyer

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:13.600
um honestly musical sound designer you don't need an industry like giant you don't need

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.800
like a triple a musical sound designer you need someone from the community um depending

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.080
on the project that might even go for free there is the jobs and freelancer section and

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.720
there is a bunch of community people out there that would love to be part of your project

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:33.420
uh you can also use um massively licensed sound i know i use kevin mcclood's uh collection

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:38.920
a lot in moc some corrections from cole's and rusio that says that the uh new user events

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.960
only were the ones that used them uh for the next decisions great i was aware they were

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.600
being used but not exactly how they were being used and then uh rusio says that the the

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:54.360
funeral event seat the fronal event um used them for the new player nights they worked

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.240
quite well uh and then hack posted a uh picture uh which shows how they were using them uh

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.260
yes that is a suitable setup for how you would use them with that i believe we are out of

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:10.880
time we were like we're way out of time i i like remembering is that especially when

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:18.000
i was in the hotel room world with the car someone spawned the very complex mmc car in

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.800
one of the hotel rooms and it freaked out because of course it was a very narrow space

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.300
and so it would periodically just sort of teleport into the hotel room sweep people

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.760
into it because it sort of had like an auto anchor system on it and then glitch out of

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.800
the map and fall down again and so if you weren't careful you would just like be attacked

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:43.160
by a car periodically as it like grabbed you forcibly put you in its seats and then teleported

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:48.920
out of existence it was basically an scp waiting to happen i will see you guys later um we

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.280
are out of time go ahead and uh call it here if you have questions please dm me or drop

00:29:53.280 --> 00:30:15.120
them here i might respond in text form and i'll speak to you later bye
