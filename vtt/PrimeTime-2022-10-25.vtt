00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to prime time, the weekly AMA for me and Neos.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you have questions, please drop them in the office hours text chat.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That is a few channels above, there is a thread for your questions.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Any questions about Neos will be answered in the order that they appear.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Whilst there are no questions in that thread, we will sit in unimaginable silence.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I hope that you've had a fantastic week.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If you have questions, drop them in the thread and I'll get to them as soon as I can.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Thank you.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Okay, so we have our first question from Lex.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Lex says, is there an in-depth explanation on how the asset variation system works?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There is not.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I can give you a sort of brief overview now, which will help for those people who are just like, what is that?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm sure that Lex yourself, you know a little bit about what it does when doing it for the benefit of those who are listening.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So the asset variance system is a system where when you give Neos an asset, an asset being a texture, a model, a sound,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
anything that like isn't actually an object, but is like parts of the object and not logics or components,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
just like the visual aspects, the models, the textures, the sounds, the videos, etc.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When you give Neos one of those, it will run it through what's called the asset variation system,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
or variant system, which is what we usually call it, not variation,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which is basically designed to make it cheaper for us as Neos to store those assets on the Neos cloud,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but also better for you guys to download and witness those assets with inside Neos or inside your sessions.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The notable example of this, which you'll probably see and have seen and wonder what the hell is going on,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is things like normal maps. So in Neos, when you drag a normal map into the normal map square of a material,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you'll notice that it turns from the sort of standard normal map, the blue, into a normal map, which is red.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Turns out that storing a normal map in that red format, technically speaking, there's technicalities here,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but I'm just going to say the colors red and blue a bunch until we move on to the next question.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Technically speaking, storing it in the red format is more optimal and has less storage requirements,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
bandwidth requirements, etc. to get to you than in the blue format.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So we're doing that on behalf of you and it honestly is generally better.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
There are a lot of cases where I've seen where users are just like deliberately asking the asset

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the asset variant system to just not run and it bothers me.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I do have a video about that one on the channel that talks more about the asset system that runs in a world

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
rather than the one that runs on a cloud, but it's kind of the same thing.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's like let Neos do what it thinks is best, unless it actually isn't best, right?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You have no reason to overrule the asset variant system or the asset management system within a world

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
unless you know exactly that you need to do that and have a good reason to do it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So I'll link that video in the thread.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But there's no like full definition there, hence why I had to gloss over some details.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Some of them I don't really know myself either.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I do know, as I was reading in a conversation later, earlier, I don't know why I said later.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Yes, I was reading in the future that I travel back in time to this office hours to tell you about it.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I was reading earlier in a conversation somewhere else that Fruks is actually very proud of the asset

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
variant system, so that's good to hear. I'm happy that he's proud of his work.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I do hope that we'll get some documentation on that when we can.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And I understand that that response probably wasn't that good.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Hey, it should have helped those out that don't know anything about it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Dio says, what's the featured cheese for today?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I don't answer cheese questions. There are no exceptions to that.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I almost did, but I'm like, nope, no cheese questions.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So moving on.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So Zach says, all optimization be prioritized when things pick up again.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Losing words here. There's only like a defined amount of English words one can say in a day.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And when I run out of those, usually five minutes after I wake up, I just start like speaking absolute gobbledygook.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I can't really say what is going to be prioritized when things pick up because priorities change.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And in a lot of cases, priorities are influenced by multiple things, right?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So the way that the roadmap was back when we were doing optimization, sorry, when we were doing stuff before this mess,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
we had different priorities because we had two additional team members that we were listening to,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and their priorities were factored into it, et cetera.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Our priorities before this mess were to rework the settings UI simply because we need to.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
There's just too many settings that we need to set.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So we needed a new settings UI, and then immediately following that, we're going to look into user blocking.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
None of those happened, of course. See the announcements channel for more information.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm not going to talk about that right now.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We will endeavor to optimize Neos wherever we can.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Sometimes optimizations appear when you least expect it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
The other day I was editing the volume plane slicer, which is for things like MRIs and stuff,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and I rewrote parts of it to be half the code.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Now, that isn't optimized in terms of performance, but that is optimized in terms of my brain when I read that file.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So, you know, multiple types of optimization.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
You can be, I guess, more specific about what optimizations you're looking forward to. I can talk about those for a little bit.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
We have a question here from Mr. Very to the point username. Hello, Mr.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Is there any plans on reworking the current main menu, escape menu for a better user interface and user experience?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Every single part of the Neos UI is due for rework.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Even the parts that we have already reworked are due for rework.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
None of the UI is like final, and I don't think it ever will be.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But in this particular case, none of the UI has entered even its non-beta stage.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
You've got to remember that Neos is early access and in beta.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So, yeah, everything will be reworked.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
If you're looking for things like that, head over to our UI remap and just control F the word dark,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and you'll just see it everywhere, because the common question we get is like, can we get dark mode here?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And it's like, yes, you could have dark mode on literally everything once we rework the UI.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And it's all on that UI roadmap, and you can find information about it, such as our plans, our ideas,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
what we're thinking about on that UI roadmap more than I can speak to right here.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Projects one, I believe, is the major roadmap property.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I believe they want projects two, which is the UI roadmap.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Yeah, projects two is the UI roadmap.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
No worries. Projects one is great too.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
In fact, if you just go to like Neos public projects and you just read all of them, that'll be great.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
When we get things back up and running, I will be working.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
For those who don't know, I am a traditionally trained engineer and product manager now, so hooray.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I've got about five years in each of those disciplines. That's great.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So I'll be reworking that roadmap to be less boards.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I think the multiple board thing is kind of bad.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
You also see on GitHub now that our project boards are listed under projects in brackets classic,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and that's because GitHub released a new projects format that allows us to do a lot more things,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
including views, tagging, custom fields, all sorts of cool stuff.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And that will let us collapse all those down into one board once we get going again.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
There we go. That's all the questions.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I hope that you are all having a fantastic day.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I'm going to go ahead and sit here in unimaginable science until we get more questions.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Okay. We do have a question here. Fantastic.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So we have a repeat. So Ramper says, let me repeat one thing I mentioned during the moderation office.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I knew about it too.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I think there should be enough.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
See, just running out of English.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I'll get a handle on it, I promise.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I think there should be an official explanation on the FAQ why Quest Standalone is not yet supported.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Usually when I explain why people snap back with something like, what do you mean?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
VRC already did it, and Bonelab is a prime example of running on the Quest Philly.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Those sorts of people, they're asking the wrong question, I think.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It's a very stereotypical thing.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It happens a lot in video games or other products or basically just everything.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
You can even take it back to construction.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
You drive past on your way to work a bridge that's being built every day for five years,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and you go, why haven't they finished building the bridge yet?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And they just have no concept or knowledge about why that is the case.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So there is certainly something that we can do there to make that clearer in that case.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But for the people who retort with VRC already did it, there's less that we can do

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
because they're less reasonable.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So if you're answering why and explaining the constraints and the concepts there,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I don't think there's much more that we can do than that.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But we can add the constraints, the reasons, the why to the FAQ,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and that should at least alleviate those people who will read that and understand that.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I could probably, for some of those users, I could sit here around a circle with some campfires

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and some s'mores and be like, here's exactly why we don't have Quest support.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And I could get out diagrams and charts and lines and graphs.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
What's that image with the conspiracy theory thing from the comedy?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I don't remember what show it is.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
You know the one, the meme image.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I don't know a lot.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
That one, yes, that one.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I could do that, that image.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I could do that image for hours, and that kind of person might still say that VRC already did it.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And that just means that they don't have the right attitude to listen to us.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So there's certainly more we can do in the FAQ there to lower the amount of them.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
You can't win them all, but we could win back a few more by editing the FAQ

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
to be a little bit more detailed in the area.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Additionally, we sometimes get feedback about why it says on the website that we do support Quest

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and we don't support Quest.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
You know why that is.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We don't even say what's going on there.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
The website also says that we're in a partner with various educational establishments.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And while we do have people that work at those educational establishments who use Neos,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
the word partner means that there's some paperwork in place,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and there is not paperwork in place for some of those.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Or there might be, I don't know.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
But I know for a fact that there is not paperwork available for some of those places,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
so I wouldn't call them an official partner.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
But hey, that's the website for you.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I mean, we could buy the logic that is being used to put partners on there.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
We could have put Microsoft on there when I worked for Microsoft and said,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
yeah, because a Microsoft employee uses Neos and works for it, we're partnered with Microsoft.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
It's like, it doesn't work like that.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Like a partnership is a partnership, right?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
If you like Google partnership on like a stock image website,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
you'll probably see a lot of like people wearing suits shaking hands.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
If there's no shaking hands or wearing suits, then it's not a partnership.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Yeah, Zach is a perfect example of partnership, a stock image.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Hey, do any of you work for like a grocery store or a fast food establishment?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
We're partnered with those two, because you know, you play Neos.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Yeah, I noticed. I'm glad about that.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It keeps them organized.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I should probably look into Lex's stuff rather than Sounder.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Sounder was great until like, I don't know, I complained about their transcription editor

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and then they like appear to have removed the transcription editor.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I don't understand.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I used to be able to basically be like, cool, I'm going to edit the transcriptions and make them better.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And then they're like, it didn't work.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And I tweeted them about it and then they tweeted me back and then they removed the transcription editor.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Oh, God, here we go. Here's a big one.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I'll do my best, Lex.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Lex says, I had a conversation a while back when I found out putting NeosDB links that aren't yours in a URI field

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
would make the object count that asset link.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
That was a card chain towards your storage space.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And that is intentional design with the reasons being here.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.000
In my opinion, I think that having dead links would be better than not having your storage space be taken up due to the possibility of this.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000
What is your opinion on the duplication of assets for conservation of assets?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I don't have an opinion because I don't really understand what's going there.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I've read like everything you've done on that particular issue like three times and dug into the code a little bit.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I don't understand what's going on there.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I do think that there could be a way to do it that is obviously better for your space.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
However, as aligned with the things to avoid list,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:41.000
using other NeosDB links in URI fields should be a limited thing right now.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I mean, if cloud spawning, sure, but we don't support it right now officially.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
But I don't know why that would come up in reality.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Like if you come up with a scenario where it comes up in reality, then we might actually come up with a scenario where

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
A, we can change that feature because your scenario is impactful,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
or B, where we can come up with a slightly different feature that works to solve that gap.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I don't know.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
But yeah, I haven't looked into it enough to like really understand what's going on.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I don't think uploading movies is against the guidelines.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
It is sort of against the EULA and our like terms of service-y thing and stuff like that.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
There is guideline stuff for copyrighted material, of course, as well.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But it's difficult to like, it's difficult for us to enforce that.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Otherwise, we'd have to start enforcing everything.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
What I would say for those who are watching movies, if you want to share movies with people,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
the worst movie provider is the Neos cloud.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Get a Plex server or some RTMP server, you'll have a much better time syncing files,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
keeping everyone up to date, making sure there's no drift.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
You'll have a lot better experience with subtitles.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
You'll have a lot better scenario with storage as well.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
You won't stick your sync.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
You won't cause like Cosmos DB 429 errors.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It's the worst place to store movies.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I've also thought, and this isn't an announcement saying we're going to do this, so don't be scared,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
but I thought, and thinking is good, remember, theoretical thinking about problems is how you learn,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I thought about how would we maybe like discourage this movie thing.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Well, we could see, hmm, how big is this file and what type of file it is.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Oh, it's a four-hour video? Great.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Must be the latest Marvel film.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So, you know, then we could maybe say like, hmm, maybe we don't want to sync that.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
But it's really subjective because there are cases where you might want to sync a very big video file to the NEOS Cloud.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
However, in summary, if you want movies in NEOS, I don't recommend the NEOS Cloud.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I recommend like some other form of getting that information into NEOS.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Rampa mentions content ID.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
We could, again, this is not an announcement.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We are not doing this, but we could totally do YouTube's content ID on every single video uploaded to the NEOS Cloud,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
just so you're aware. We could. We're not, but we could.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Moving forwards to, let's see, any other questions?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Okay, Zach has a question here.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Hey, like, I'm really sorry about this because like 90% of questions I get with syncing are exactly the same problem.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Every time someone reports a syncing issue, I go back to the sync Wiki pages and take a look at them.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And they have the appropriate information on them, so please read the sync Wiki issues.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And if you continue to have issues about that, please post logs in the Bugs and Feedback channel.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Not like screenshots of logs, not segments of logs, whole log files.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And take a look at that because any updates on the syncing issue will be reflected on those Wiki pages.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And that is, like, it's because, like, I'm sorry, but, like, I'm tired of talking about sync issues.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
There is literally nothing I can do, and so therefore I'm trying to standardize that any absolute feedback I have

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.000
about stuck syncs or sync issues is going to be documented on the Wiki such that I make myself redundant

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
as a person talking about sync issues.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Like, I want it to be like a one-stop shop.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
You know when you go to the doctor and they're like, all right, we're going to take your temperature

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and then we're going to, like, I don't know, prod you a bit?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I want, like, sync to be resolved like that as best as I can, because that's all I can do right now.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Like, the real solve for sync is, like, some code updates.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
But, you know, it's interesting enough, actually, and here's a random tangent, which is amazing,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
because you're going to enjoy this tangent, except those who don't enjoy the tangents.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
But if you're here for the tangents, you're going to enjoy this one.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I used to work for a motorsport management software system company.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
So we made management systems for motorsports events around the world, Australia, America, the UK,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
you name it, I've been there, wherever there's a racetrack.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And we have this problem whereby a motorcycle rider has a bunch of motorcycles,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
because they're trying to enter as many races as possible to get as much sponsorship money as possible.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So if you have a 600cc bike and a 1200cc bike, those obviously cannot be entered into the same category of race,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
because they're in lightweight and heavyweight classes, as in how big your bike is, how roaring the engine is, et cetera.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Now, we came up with a system which is a questionnaire, and you just fill in what your bike is.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
So you say, like, what's the cc of your bike? You enter it.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000
You're like, does your bike have four legs, three arms, an upside-down sandwich or whatever?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
You keep filling in questions. And what the expert system does is it figures out which classes you're for.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And, like, Eclat system is just like a defined computer software algorithm.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And I want to do that with the whole sync issue, because it's driving me mad, basically.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I don't mean to be bad to anyone, but I basically want to go to this website where it's like,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
are you experiencing a syncing problem? Yes. Please upload a log file. Log file updated. Next.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
All right. We've discovered that in your log file, this has happened. Have you tried doing this?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Yes. Next. And it will just keep going until it spits out, like, the exact answer for you so I can stop talking about them.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So I'm trying to get that going as well. Expert systems are cool.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
You will get some resources in the doobly-doos about that.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Oh, a good example of an expert system is the Akinator.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
You know, the one that guesses which character you are? That's an expert system.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I will now reread your question, though, as I just went off on a very large tangent about sync issues.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I don't understand what the problem there is. Are you saying that you're confused about why it's so slow?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.000
In which case it's slow, probably, either for internet, which you say it's not internet, although it still might be internet because internet is complicated, depending on where you are in the world, et cetera.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000
It could also be indexing. Like, we need to know what we're sending, right? So it chunks up the file and then sends it in Prequence.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:22.000
I actually have no idea anything about bikes. The way that we wrote the system, we had another system, namely called the rulebook for the motorsport organisation we work for, which defined the expert system rules.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So they would say, hey, we're a new customer. And I would say, great, have you got your rulebook? And they would say yes.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And they would give me the rulebook. And based on the rulebook, I wouldn't even understand what I was reading.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I would program the expert system. And then we would put some test bikes through it, and then inevitably when the first event for that motorsport championship would happen, we would get a bunch of calls and emails.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And they'd be like, this motorcycle should be allowed in this race, but your system says it's not allowed. And I'd be like, okay, according to the rulebook, section three, paragraph four, subsection A, that bike isn't allowed.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Could you clarify this, please? And we went backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards until we just had an exception system where they could say, here is an exception.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:21.000
This bike can actually enter this particular race course. And it always had a justification field where we required like clock of the course, which by the way is like the director of the event, to like put in a reason there.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:33.000
So like worlds are very, very complicated. So I'm going to try and do an example. Again, this is like wishy washy because I haven't read all that code yet.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Neos is huge, right? So let's imagine that you have a really complicated object. So I'm just going to be de facto a meme and say a custom inspector or a custom multi-tool.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:54.000
That's a really complicated object. There's slots everywhere. It's very, very big. Saving that to your inventory is going to take a defined amount of time because of how big and complicated it is.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Let's now put seven of those in a world. It's then going to have to say the exact state of seven of those in the world. And so it's going to times that object saving by seven.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.000
It will be a little bit lost, so it might be six or five because there are some duplicates it can link up. But it still needs to know like the location of all of those objects, all of those slots.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:28.000
So if there's a hundred slots, each have individual position rotation scales, and then all of the variables that exist on there, a value field that says two, another value field that says four, it's got to save all those.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000
And the whole way it works is whenever you save a world, it takes the entire world, serializes it to a big database, and then just shoves it in the cloud.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And so that will take longer for worlds than it does for individual objects simply because of how much stuff is there and how complicated that is.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:54.000
It's the equivalent of basically saying I would like to ship in terms of a moving company my entire apartment or one room of my apartment.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.000
It's a magnitude bigger because of how much more stuff there is and where that stuff is located.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
So if your home is taking a long time, maybe consider removing stuff in your home.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Personally, I don't use my home world. I think it's silly that people do put lots of stuff in their home world.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
My home world is basically a diving board into the rest of Neos.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Zach asks, could it be my RAM and CPU? Probably not. Probably not.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000
OK, moving forwards, Rockman says, what do you think of the Quest Pro and how does Neos face and eye tracking work?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
So Neos face and eye tracking, by my knowledge, currently does not work for Neos.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000
I created an issue for both the HTC Vive focus series and the Quest Pro, which can be tracked at this following link.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And once this issue is closed, we will support those headsets.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
As for what I think about them, I am disappointed that the Quest Pro is $1,500.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
I'm also disappointed that the Quest Pro is lacking certain features.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I'm also incredibly disappointed that at the keynote for the Quest Pro and related stuff, they had pre-animated demos of some of the technologies there.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.000
I won't be buying any headset before I've seen a hands-on review from people who I can trust, such as the larger VR content creators,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
and in some cases, before I can even go and take a look at the headset and put it on.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Headsets are heavy and uncomfortable, and before I drop $1,500 on something, I need to know what's going on.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
The last time I did that was with an index, and that was a risk, and it was OK.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
We're still talking about Zach's home world. Let's take a look at what's going on.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Saving is different from loading. The CPU freeze during loading is probably a different problem than saving.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Yeah, weight distribution is also massive.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
That's why the headsets have so many straps and stuff like that, right?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.000
You need to adjust those. Read the manual for your headset and see if you're adjusting those straps correctly.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Because if you're not, you're probably pulling your face off.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000
I just got this picture of someone ripping their face off when it's stuck to a headset.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Sometimes I feel like that after 12 hours in VR. Anyway, let's take this question I missed.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Mr. has a question. Fantastic. Sorry I missed it. Thanks, Lex, for linking it.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
So after headless was introduced, is there any plans for servers?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Yes. Headless servers aren't servers, and I feel like I should get that on a t-shirt or something.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Headless servers are not our final envisioning for servers. Servers are.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
We don't quite know what the gap between headless servers and servers will.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I love these tongue twisters today.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000
But it would be more tailored to being run in a data center.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:00.000
And there also might be an opportunity or system or way that Neos runs some servers for you on behalf of the session host and things like that.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
There are plans. I think there's some GitHub issues somewhere. You'd have to dig through them, though.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Sometimes, in office hours, I feel like a search engine.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
So I'm going to go type the word servers into our issue list and see what I can find.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Yeah, so there's a couple of relevant issues.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
There's this, which is like spooling up headless sessions.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
You'll see Shifty says here dedicated servers are planned.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
So that to me suggests there might be something on the roadmap.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
So I'll go take a look at the roadmap.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Probably been a major roadmap here.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
It did find that. I only found one.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Okay. Yeah, we need a card for that.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
You can find some information there from Shifty and from Fricks.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And with that, I believe we're at the end of questions.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
I do apologize for the continual sync issues.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
I'm just like, I'm tired of seeing them.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Not because it's your fault, but because it's our fault.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
I'm tired of there not being an ability for me to better solve that issue for you guys.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
So in lieu of that, I'm trying to make your experience better.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And I want your experience to be you go to a Wiki page and you find your solution.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
I don't want you to have to like spam staff or just like say in chat that there's a problem.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:36.000
But to help me out there, log files, one report, and read the Wiki pages as we develop them.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
In the final few moments I've got, I'm going to just point at the Logix channel,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
where there's a video of a mathematical problem.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
There isn't an AI. I know what you mean.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
We'll just stop talking about syncing now.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
In the Logix channel, by myself, there is a mathematical problem,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
which I don't understand the reason for,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
but I am continuing to work with Hamish S.H.F.R. on what the hell we need.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
So if anyone has any idea what that video means and wants to speak to me about it,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
please do take a look. It is mathematical in nature and AI rotationally in nature.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
We appear to be on to something, though.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
We've rigged up a new test rig that might show the problem a little bit better.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
So if there is a solution there, or at least a problem identification option thingy there,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
then I'll update the video or something.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
With that, I'm going to go ahead and draw this to a close,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
and I will see you guys next week, hopefully for additional questions and awesomeness.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:28:00.000
I will speak to you later. Good bye.
