00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 Welcome to Office Hours, it's now 4pm so we're going to go ahead and get started.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.840
 Right on cue, my living room lights just turned on because I got them set to turn on at 4pm.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.920
 And we're going to go ahead and get started by scrolling through the list of questions.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.200
 So Lou Zanth says, "Is there a list of slot names for temporary badges, fruits, account

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.200
 creation, bread, etc?"

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.080
 There is not, it particularly doesn't help that a lot of those are, what we do is we

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.680
 copy the previous slot when we're generating them so the name gets longer and longer.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.200
 You also shouldn't, like, what's the word, you shouldn't make your system with those

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.600
 slot names as guarantees because they may change at any time.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.680
 Depending on what you want to do with your badges, you have a few options, one is the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.000
 various aligner components or just doing it numerically, like stepping through each element

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.480
 in the list etc.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.600
 Or you could just make your own icon to-ble-do, you know, whatever sort of scheme you want.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.120
 There's a lot of people doing that recently, they don't show their actual badges, they've

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.160
 got like a custom list of badges.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.760
 Not to call anyone out here, but I believe that Shifty for example, she went down to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.400
 just the Neos team badge.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.340
 I think she was just done with badges and I perfectly understand that as the person

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.340
 with the most.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.760
 So yeah, try that out.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.800
 Moving forwards, like, "Is there any updates on the fix for the native build of Neos being

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.140
 unusable?"

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.900
 We are taking a look at that and we'll get to it as soon as we can.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.940
 Grey says, "Is there a way to stop getting office hours pings?"

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.940
 Yes.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.940
 So, the problem with that one is, it's not the office hours role isn't anything to do

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.940
 with that one.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.860
 The problem is that stages like to add everyone even though they shouldn't.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.020
 When you start a stage, there's like a button for it, but like I continually forget that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.140
 that button is there, it's just like notify the server or something like that.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.180
 I will go ahead and remember to use that setting next time I start a stage.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.840
 But if you do what the slinker posted, then you'll be able to mute that stage.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.960
 It's actually nothing to do with the office hours role, the office hours role is just

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.820
 when I hang at office hours.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.460
 When I start a stage though, it's like at everyone pretty much.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.380
 Moving forwards to the next question here.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.220
 Fuzzy says, "Can you speak faster by watching your YouTube videos at 1.5 speed?"

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.740
 No, you sound oddly slow.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.740
 Interesting.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.820
 I've always said to people, you can slow my videos down and I know a lot of people do

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.100
 do that because apparently I'm too fast.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.700
 As I've said a few times before, I'm running at probably like 50% speed during a recording

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.220
 of a tutorial because I need to explain things.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.260
 Whereas when I'm building, I can sort of barely explain anything.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.300
 Someone will watch me build and be like, "What are you doing now?"

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.740
 And I'll just be like, "I don't know.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.820
 I don't know.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.980
 Just let me do it, please."

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.940
 Ray asks, "Are we required to have internal organs to use NeoSwati?

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.120
 We have external organs."

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.080
 The state of your organs is not a topic that is covered by the Neos usage guidelines.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.300
 If it would be, there would be an update to the Neos usage guidelines.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.700
 I don't think your organs have anything to do with that.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.740
 Next question is, "Linka asks, "Any comment on the active sessions bot being down?

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.820
 It kind of died when the SSL cert on the old API."

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.340
 So I assume it's polling the old API in an ever-ending loop, most likely no idea who

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.780
 hosts it.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.460
 That one I had not realized.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.700
 I will raise that with the team when I can.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.940
 Let me just make a note of that one.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.260
 And with that, we are currently out of questions.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.660
 If you would go ahead and come up with more questions.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.060
 Or don't, it's completely up to you.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.980
 Ray asks, "Does the drive node constantly update whenever it's driving, or only when

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.100
 the input value updates?"

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.100
 That is -- do you mean the drive drive node, the one that's in actions?

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.380
 Or do you mean just the arrow, like a regular drive?

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.140
 Okay, you mean the drive drive node.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.860
 So the drive drive node is effectively equivalent to the drive arrow, for those who are unaware.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.740
 If you see an arrow that's sort of got rounded corners in logic, that's a drive.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.660
 If you see a pointy sharp arrow, which is more transparent in the center of it, that's

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.660
 a reference arrow.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.340
 So there's a good sort of rule of thumb to identify the difference.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.740
 If it's rounded, it's a drive.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.020
 But the drive drive node basically sets up one of those drive arrows, but programmatically

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.420
 allowing you to sort of start and stop it with that node.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.540
 So it functions identically to an actual drive, it just has more controls, and you can start

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.740
 and stop that drive.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.860
 So therefore it has the same rules as a regular drive.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.900
 And the regular drive is based on a sort of notification system that sort of floods through

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.400
 the wires a little bit, like electricity would.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.120
 So if we think about the simplest logic circuit that you can think of, which is adding two

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.860
 numbers together and then driving the result of how big a sphere is with the result.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.060
 Let's say you put 1+1, you add it together, you get 2, and then you drive the size of

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.260
 the sphere with that.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.420
 At that state, nothing is changing, nothing is updating, because the value of 1+1 equaling

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.020
 2 is constant, and Neos knows that.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.940
 If you then edit one of those input nodes to maybe change that 1 to a 2 or whatever

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.900
 number it is, you cause an update, both on the network to sort of say to anyone else

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.660
 in the session, "hey, this value is now 3" or whatever you put in, but also in terms

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.820
 of logic where it will re-evaluate that chain.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.700
 It will flow out of the input node into the plus node and tell the plus node "yo man,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.460
 update your value" and then the plus node goes "got it bro, updating my value" and

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.700
 then it passes that on to the drive system.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.700
 So that's how it works.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.900
 There are of course exceptions, things like updating relay which will force stuff to continually

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.180
 evaluate and various nodes which just by their nature force stuff to continually evaluate.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.860
 So it does depend.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.580
 The goal is basically to not do mathematics twice, we don't need to.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.260
 1+1 is always 2.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.140
 Although I did watch a long time ago, someone linked me this video of this, it was either

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:12.260
 a retired military person or it was like a retired teacher, professor, scientist or something

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:18.060
 like that, and they were just rambling in front of a whiteboard about how they'd invented

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.260
 a new form of power based on the principle that 1+1 equaled 1 and it went on forever

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.980
 and it was like a fever dream, it was amazing.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.820
 They were talking about the east and west magnetic poles as well and it was just like

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.820
 "what?"

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.260
 It was very confusing, but there we go.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
 The CloutPanda says "how's my week been?

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.980
 Also we had a comment on hope you have a headache-free day from Jackal at the start of office hours"

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.980
 yeah, pretty good day.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.940
 I'm probably going to TMI for a moment here.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.460
 I was cleaning my bathroom yesterday right, and I needed to replace the toilet seat because

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.340
 it's old and it was cracking and I wanted to replace it, so I bought what I thought

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.580
 was an identical toilet seat.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.660
 It turns out it was the wrong size.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.260
 So just imagine me holding this new toilet seat triumphantly over my toilet, trying to

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.380
 affix it, screwing it all down, looking at it and being like "that looks stupid" because

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:16.740
 it was the wrong shape, and then having to unscrew it gently with much aggression, throw

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.980
 place gently the new toilet seat to the side and then re-affix the old one, grumpily.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.480
 Well it was gently, because if I throw it I'd probably damage a wall and it's a rental,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.860
 so it was as aggressive as gentle can be to not damage anything.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.420
 I do wish I owned my own place outright, because then I could do what my dad does when stuff

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.460
 annoys him, he just says "that's going up the garden" and he means it.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.680
 So there was this one time where there was a party, and he was using a blender to make

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.180
 a sauce or something, I don't remember, but the blender just stopped working, and

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:56.180
 he just opened the back door and just yeeted it into the garden, because that's where it

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.900
 belonged apparently.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:06.300
 Moving forwards to Fuzzy's question, which says "been having trouble" exactly like that

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.300
 gif, that's from the office isn't it?

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.300
 I don't know.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.780
 Fuzzy's question "been having trouble working out the various inn, user inn headset,

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.740
 etc. knows this, they don't appear to work agree with each other, trying to take AFK

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:24.260
 type situations, things seem inconsistent" You need an updating relay for those, and

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.180
 then you should be able to work out the difference, just make sure you've got an updating relay

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.180
 for those.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.460
 I think Is User Present is like an "and" between the other ones.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.500
 I can open up Is User Present now, just go to the tab to the correct Visual Studio project,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.260
 seeing as I have 1, 2, 3, 4 open today, I don't know why.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.340
 Is User Present.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:53.740
 Is User Present will swap itself with Is User Present in World when it loads.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.700
 Is User Present is not a node that we have, it will just swap around.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.060
 Looks like we didn't remove it from the list, which is weird.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.800
 No no no no no, hold on, hold on, I read that wrong.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.300
 One moment here.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:14.340
 If your Is User Present node existed before a certain date, when you load it will be swapped

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.300
 with Is User Present in World.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.180
 After that fact, it will still work as Is Present.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.100
 Is Present.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:35.420
 Is Present is present in headset, or not VR active and is present in world.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.860
 So are they in the headset and are they in the session?

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.420
 Is Present inside the world, are they in this world?

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.880
 No man, they're totally out of this world.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.060
 Is Present in headset, is their headset working?

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.020
 Sorry, is their headset on?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:02.580
 Yeah, our version management systems are fantastic.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.940
 I've been trying to encourage us to do as a team, is to when we do that stuff, leave

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.060
 a comment saying why.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:16.500
 There's a lot in programming and opinions about how useful comments are, etc.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.580
 Some people say that the code should explain the why, and I'm just like nope.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.620
 Code sometimes cannot explain why.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.040
 So comments are needed to explain why.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.140
 And then code purists will come after me and they'll say "oh but if you update the code

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.320
 then the comments are out of date" and I say well then your pull request or your code

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.220
 review process should include an item saying "I have updated comments around this area

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.820
 to make it make sense" and if it doesn't then that's a bad engineer.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.160
 You know, it should just be no excuse for it.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:54.140
 So if it's unclear why, or you think "hey 3am prime won't understand what I was doing

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.020
 here later" then I add a comment.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.160
 There are actually some times where I add a comment with a link to the Stack Overflow

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.960
 question where I got the stuff from.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.740
 That's good because it provides credit.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.440
 But it's also good because I go back to it and I'm like "what is this eldritch chicken

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.440
 scratch here?

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.320
 Why have you done it this way?"

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.260
 And the answer is "because you spent 3 hours and here was the answer you found on Stack

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.660
 Overflow after 3 hours" so I've even said "hey we can even reference issues, for example

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.440
 if something weird happened we can just put a comment saying 'this is why we did it'

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.140
 and then we can literally reference the github issue because it'll be there as long as github

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.680
 is up" which I don't imagine it going down any time soon.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:40.560
 That's that question, I want to scroll through and make sure we got... okay that's that done.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.940
 I think we're out of questions now.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.800
 Fuzzy is asking a cloud variable question which is why I'm giggling because cloud variables

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.980
 are... cloud variables are unfinished which is why they're so confusing.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.240
 I'm so sorry that cloud variables are so confusing.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.560
 I have to consult the oracle.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560
 Give me a second.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.640
 By the oracle I mean my documentation on the wiki which is sometimes wrong.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:13.000
 It was wrong, I updated a bunch of it but like it's always wrong.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.960
 You're asking about definition only... definition owner only unsafe.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.300
 Okay definition own own... do you... can't even say it.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.820
 Definition owner... no.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.560
 Definition owner only unsafe can be used by users and groups.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:38.600
 Definition owner only unsafe is only used for a singular value and it's in read write

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.840
 permissions though so it's useful for version control systems.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:51.760
 I don't know if you uclops here but like definition owner only unsafe would be what I might use

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:57.200
 if the wiki is correct which it might not be for the version detection system which

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.320
 redprint has for example.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.020
 I would probably use definition owner only there which means I could set the version

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.840
 number inside the dash because I didn't want someone doing some hacky logics to do it in

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.640
 an unsafe way with like "you guys there's a new version of redprint and it's called

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:23.360
 version 17400 and cheese" which could theoretically happen if you use definition owner only unsafe

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.680
 because it can be set in an unsafe context.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:35.520
 You set that for a read permission on a variable and it's still readable in world using a user

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.880
 from username node unless read by... you set it for...

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.120
 I'd have to look at like the setup and the configuration and which logics nodes you're

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.120
 doing so if you can share that we can look at it more.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.080
 Great like it's not like there is no node by that name.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.640
 Can we like yeah can we can we just you know tone that down I'm looking at the full node

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.640
 list here.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.800
 Yep I know that name.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.440
 Oh confusing the stage also has a chat channel oh my god we should probably like switch to

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.880
 that at some point yeah.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.520
 Anyway moving on to questions.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.940
 Fuzzy wants a variable only they could okay so if you want it only that you can read it

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.280
 definition owner only without the unsafe would be the way that you do it because with the

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:28.280
 unsafe it means that people can read it if you're in the session and they know their

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.800
 way around logics.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.680
 The oo node is a joke node you're not meant to use it for anything concrete it's just

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:43.000
 outputs what's this much like the b0 3 all node which is just a typo that for example

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.800
 funny so put it into the code.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.600
 I was actually thinking about this the other day and hey this is this is my space to talk

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:56.440
 about random stuff including toilet seats so Microsoft has a policy where we don't do

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:03.080
 April Fools jokes and because of my time at that company I agree I completely agree that

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:11.520
 companies should not do April Fools jokes and what happened is that order or like directive

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.360
 or I guess policy but the right word since we're not talking about military came directly

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:23.180
 from like the chief legal officer of Microsoft and the reason behind that is like they calculated

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:29.720
 the like cost in terms of sort of marketing legal financial etc about putting out something

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.680
 that was confusing and it was large like say for example you put out like you know today

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:43.480
 Microsoft is releasing Microsoft cheese because it's April Fools or Microsoft Pi 3.1.4 etc

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:50.080
 some person somewhere is going to be confused by that and they're going to have some action

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:57.080
 that may lead to a decline in reputation revenue legal standing stock price whatever so they

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.080
 were just like nope we don't do it anymore and I just completely agree with that so I

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.000
 want more companies to sort of do that measurement if they're like really small it's probably

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.320
 not going to matter but like when it comes to like a gigantic company like Microsoft

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.840
 it just like makes sense.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.240
 Zari says it always backfires it's not like it always backfires it's like the potential

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:23.120
 for backfiring is higher than the reward right if you want to be funny be funny 365 days

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.360
 a year you can see that with the social media accounts for brands where they're trying to

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:33.360
 be funny sometimes they aren't funny sometimes they are but they are consistently trying

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.600
 if the brand is only quote funny on April 1st then it's just it's really weird like

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:44.080
 I kind of like for example I like Discord's brand Discord's brand is it feels quite young

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.680
 it doesn't feel stuffy it doesn't feel you know too corporate like and that's because

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.600
 they work on that brand every single time they do an announcement every single time

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.080
 they do a release there's a frog on my head for example.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:05.040
 I don't answer cheese questions here yes questions or questions about toilet seats those are

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.280
 mine today all right I don't see any other questions although fuzzy does say sorry for

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.000
 all the dumb questions there is no such thing as a dumb question if you don't understand

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.520
 something you have two choices in the world and that is to try and understand it or to

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.240
 give up and trying to understand it is always the best option so please ask questions there

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:30.500
 are like dumbly worded questions I guess would be the sort of term to use it you can read

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:37.760
 all of that that at a page called asking good questions you could just Google I can't remember

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.420
 the exact one I was looking for but yeah just how to ask good questions that's also the

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:48.260
 XY problem etc let's take a look I have questions Tiki says to save something like a personal

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.880
 playlist what kind of storage should I use playlist of videos I wouldn't recommend cloud

00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:01.260
 variables for that because lists are of course difficult you could comma separate value or

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.120
 tab separated value or whatever the hell you want separated value a list of videos into

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.880
 a cloud variable definition owner again is the sort of variant of permissions that you

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.740
 need as as fuzzy as struggling with those you'll probably have to do some experimentation

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.500
 but I wouldn't recommend cloud variables for a personal playlist when it comes to music

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.860
 and playlists I actually recommend especially if it's a YouTube playlist make a YouTube

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:29.180
 playlist and then you can like put that YouTube playlist into some of the players we have

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:34.460
 in game and it will play that playlist and in some cases and I apologize for bringing

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.100
 this up in some cases consider whether you need to play your music to everyone else in

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.140
 the world gray says just check I think the user mesh hide component is broken yeah I

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.840
 don't know what that one is either like this is another sort of like we need we need comments

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:53.260
 and it's like avatar user mesh hider what do you think it does because I've just read

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.940
 what it does and to answer your question I need to know what you think it does I've just

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.420
 been through the entire node list gray like there's not a node by that name like I did

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.480
 control T typed in that and then I scroll through the entire list and I need to scroll

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.420
 down I'm sorry I don't realize I was gonna scroll down apologies for that I'll take a

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.940
 look now sometimes I just forget a scroll bar exists I blame it being like almost the

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.080
 same color as the background angry pilot says is it technically possible for users in the

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.800
 US to load a resource pics videos etc from other user host if it's only available on

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:33.440
 a local server for that host I don't know what you're asking let me read it again is

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.240
 it any possible for users in news to load a resource from other users or the host if

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.440
 it's only available on a local server for that host no the load would have to be triggered

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:48.080
 by the person who owns it a good example for that would be let's say you have the latest

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:54.000
 funny meme tik tok video on your hard drive you would have to import it for people to

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.880
 be able to see it okay so catching up on the composition but use a mesh hider yeah it's

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:07.160
 for like hair and stuff like that it should work I'm reading the code for it now basically

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:15.520
 on equip it says yeah whoever's wearing the avatar we go through all the mesh renderers

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.240
 are the ones that aren't on the exclude list it will just hide which which sounds backwards

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:30.160
 I feel it should be like an include not an exclude list like hide the hair hide the hat

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.120
 linker says that it does work people just think it hides the other yeah yeah people

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:41.920
 I remember also thinking that the avatar mesh avatar user mesh hider was also some sort

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.280
 of like safety feature right it sounds like user blocking it is not all of that will be

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:53.840
 fixed by you know documentation it also be fixed in some cases by just having those features

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:59.880
 generically yeah it just like it does a value user override for the for the hair etc it

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:06.960
 will include mirrors it will include cameras anything rendered from the point of view of

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:13.200
 the user who has it equipped camera avatar mirror whatever will have the effect like

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.200
 if you wanted to do it if I don't know a photo shoot let's say you're dancing or whatever

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.600
 you would have to get a camera person that didn't do that yeah it probably I mean I don't

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.720
 know there's no comments in the code base around why it was added but it probably existed

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.440
 before we had the net the near clip adjustments and it was probably something for excited

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:36.840
 to give people additional options that weren't hey just do it do it vrchat does guys just

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:42.400
 just do it just do what vrchat does which is where they like shrink your head to zero

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:48.880
 from your head camera only right let's move forwards fuzzy says had some witness today

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.440
 running headless or custom URL one person couldn't join through a button facet I made

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.920
 although it's been working for weeks and work for me after giving them a regular invite

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.840
 they were able to join the world and come back again using the facet not really a question

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.160
 but moreover that was an odd moment if I was gonna manage try to report it yeah depending

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:13.400
 on like the invite settings and the privacy settings even if you have a custom URL you

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.800
 sometimes can't join it without an invite like the fact that you gave them an invite

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.400
 and then the facet works makes me think it was like a permission II thing like if you

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.240
 did like I don't know I'd have to I'd have to do an entire test matrix on it and I haven't

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.760
 done that but like you could totally do that and figure out what the options are there

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.600
 switch this is just out of curiosity any info what the universe ID is for what does for

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.720
 I don't know if it works I don't think anyone's used it but universe ID is to segregate parts

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.160
 of the Neos community this sounds so like the touristic is to segregate parts of the

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.560
 Neos community into separate universes you can think of it a little bit like subreddits

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.320
 so there's an example here a school my enter universe ID of hopefully something that isn't

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.240
 just the name of the school but they're an entire universe ID and all the computers that

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.440
 run Neos and then they wouldn't be able to see us us fairies hanging out in the corner

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.200
 you know making fairy noises because they're a school they'll be on the school universe

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.380
 I've not seen anyone use it successfully I've had many occurrence where we should be using

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.120
 it but it's just not being used I don't know if that's because it doesn't work or because

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:22.240
 people aren't aware of it but there we go as an example the user Peck is a professor

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.160
 at the University of somewhere in Prague sometimes his students come in and they flood the active

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.360
 session list with a bunch of sort of new users who are also your students and so that's always

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.320
 fun to see that should probably be on its own universe like says what you think of this

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:45.720
 show 256 it's impressive I hope you had fun I won't be reading it further because it makes

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.880
 my head spin I am impressed that you got it done though picture says Aggie parts question

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.860
 was more related to network and powers if it was linked to local server on another user

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.880
 could it be opened on another user through the hose sort of similar to relaying RPCs

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:06.100
 from loading no that can't be done the avatar use a mesh

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:13.840
 is broken there's a difference between broken and not designed well it's working I guarantee

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.240
 that reading the code it's really really simple guarantee it works it's just not designed

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.940
 for the way that you want to use it so the avatar user mesh is broken it's just not designed

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.000
 the way that you want to use it there's a there's a difference there that's also why

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.520
 we have the bug issue type on GitHub and the tweak issue type on GitHub like that isn't

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.740
 a bug that's it that's a tweak you are requesting additional functionality to be added to the

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:43.400
 component thank you parlor elaborates and talks about them having a local FTP server

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.740
 and asking if news users could go through that and talk to them no that would be would

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:53.040
 have to bring would have to bring the external news user into your network which just doesn't

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.480
 exist could we ferry packets somehow there's probably some sort of protocol where we can

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:03.560
 sort of proxy or something yes so like ultimately that's possible but no you can't right now

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:10.440
 gray asks so you can make an adult universe maybe gray needs a cold shower theoretically

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:17.680
 yes but you'd have to abide by all nearest usage guidelines even on that universe so

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:23.500
 nothing in public sessions etc etc go read the guidelines there would be not much reason

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.040
 to do it is what I'm saying because you would still be breaking the guidelines if anything

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:35.200
 was public in the future perhaps eventually not now not now you might be able to do and

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:41.120
 have public adult sessions Yuki asks so question though would would wouldn't even with separate

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.640
 university you'd have access to both essential photos I think you would yeah I don't know

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.440
 how much the universe system has been implemented I just haven't had a chance to try it zinc

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.920
 has followed up with some information that says you can send it to anything really and

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.880
 then only works the world browser and you can still join in contacts it's literally

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.600
 hidden but allowed in contacts page it does nothing to folders see it's purely session

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.720
 listing gray is still claiming it's broken yeah it only does it when you equip it so

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.320
 you need to once you've set it up you need to re-equip the avatar Lex is seeing how to

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.320
 break the guidelines if someone else uses your universe ID then the universe sessions

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.860
 would show up publicly in the session browser of that content so it would still be public

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:27.840
 because it's still viewable to the public and yeah you might make a universe ID like

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:36.120
 a random alphanumeric string that is like very long but someone could still guess it

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:42.700
 gray says please don't put whatever my sorry it wasn't intention I will go ahead and make

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:48.920
 a tutorial on it for you and that way we'll see if it works Yuki says a school setting

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.180
 universe ID isn't enough they would have to delete those fault yeah I'm trying to sort

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:57.460
 of figure out and have a conversation with the team about what we do about near essentials

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.440
 and central tools I want to combine them together essential tools should just be near essentials

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:10.000
 tools and I also want to sort of come up with a way where we don't have as many orange folders

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:20.200
 inside news essentials as we do like I don't I don't like how there are team folders in

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.880
 multiple locations like I would love if it was just like in those actually a folder for

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.040
 a community folders and then inside the community folders we put all the team folders in there

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.360
 because then it would be it just like it's clear that you're entering an area that is

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.440
 not near essentials because right now they're just everywhere I also think as a team we

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.740
 need to come up with a policy of what goes in near essentials and what doesn't because

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.200
 it's very clear that some team members put useful items in there whilst those items are

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.400
 useful it's sort of like do we have a policy and what should be included and what shouldn't

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:55.200
 be included I don't so we need one those sorts of things are things that you only think about

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.980
 when you start getting into like a larger company when you're like oh you know it's

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.440
 beyond sort of like a few hundred people playing now it's a few thousand people playing now

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.240
 it's ten thousand people playing and you're like okay we need to make sure nothing goes

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:12.960
 wrong we also need a policy for what gets featured how stuff gets featured etc word

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.760
 policy might sound scary to some people but it's basically just like let's discuss it

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:22.200
 and then record that we've discussed it so that we're not confused later tiki says it

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.420
 often happens in desktop mode the world goes fully white on a session switching session

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.480
 everything's okay coming back it's still white until I respawn and ideas how this happens

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:37.160
 I had that for months literally months and then it just randomly stops so I never looked

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:42.000
 into it I apologize I don't have much more information on that one that literally happened

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.360
 for months and I've only really just now remind remembered it I could look the flashbang right

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.760
 sometimes it would happen and used to go like what's up and I like I don't mind me the flashbangs

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.780
 got off I'm gonna respond sorry says the new shield has always struck me as not being well

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.080
 placed in the official news folder yeah I don't like the new shield I don't think it

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.120
 should be there now to be clear because I know we have this issue and then in this community

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.400
 that doesn't mean I dislike the owner or the author it just means I don't personally like

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.680
 that particular item and I don't think it should be exactly writers jackal says very

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.760
 good point about nice essentials I mean there's interesting stuff in news essentials but as

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.700
 a relative newbie a lot of things have for me meaningless names because they are named

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:29.440
 for the people who built them and such and such so-and-so is creative stuff yeah there's

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.760
 also a problem where some of the items are named like you'd name a book or a film not

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.080
 how you'd name a tool like for example a screwdriver is called a screwdriver because it drives

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:46.080
 screws but in neo sland a screwdriver might be called like primes super fantastic ultimate

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:54.920
 RGB tag special ultimate RGB tag version 17 thing and you're like yeah I have no idea

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.880
 what that does and then you spawn it and there's no instructions it's just like a tool you

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:04.320
 hook up but you don't know what it does some people do have like ways around that the basic

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.720
 is one I say movies where a gearball will like parent a piece of text to the object

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.100
 which is set to non persistent when it loads so it's sort of like spawns in the text but

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:19.500
 won't hang around and it says like equip this and push left trigger to fly or whatever if

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:24.480
 you look inside the examples folder inside news essentials that's kind of sort of my

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.360
 playing ground is a little bit more organized there and sort of functional units although

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:33.160
 of course there's always more work to do on that line gray says why don't you like the

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.240
 shield the shield teaches the wrong solution to a problem so the solution to the problem

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:44.060
 is to combat the culture that you're experiencing which requires you to have the shield now

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:48.440
 of course you'll say yeah but so many new people come in and then they get our hands

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:54.680
 on stuff the you know do does stuff that the shield protects against which like okay can

00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:00.440
 a people stop making that stuff be can we stop handing out to new users see can we start

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:06.600
 educating new users on our rules and guidelines and then like D E F and G and H is like please

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.840
 report people who are consistently harassing you to moderation they need to know it's bad

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.560
 we are running over time here but I'll give you a quick example of the story I was in

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:21.360
 a world there was some unoccupied avatars in the corner a brand new user who was young

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.620
 but old enough to play the game so 13 or above came into the session and started verbally

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.720
 abusing an unoccupied avatar in the corner now of course this unoccupied avatar was unoccupied

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:37.000
 so they weren't verbally abusing some actual person but I went over and I told them off

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.600
 and I said hey this behavior isn't appropriate on this platform we don't insult each other

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.240
 we you know we have fun we hang out and they didn't really get the message for a little

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.680
 bit but a bit later they did get the message and they actually went back over to this under

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.080
 completed avatar and apologized to it and I thought that was kind of sweet I have never

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.400
 seen that user ever again I presume they went on to go play gorilla tag or something but

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.920
 it was just like a perfect example of I taught them the culture that I wish that the entirety

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.440
 of Neos had which is we see an issue we talk to them about the issue until they understand

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.680
 it and if they don't understand it we continue to talk to them about the consequences of

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:18.880
 them not understanding that issue which is the consequences are you will be kicked like

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.960
 here are the consequences of your action Lexus how do we currently change the culture without

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.840
 changes to soften it Neos essentials and updates of the platform to make it easier one way

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:34.280
 would be to I guess a few ways would be first of all recognized as a session host you do

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.520
 actually unfortunately have to go into teacher mode sometimes and do what I was just describing

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.080
 which is you explain to someone why their behavior is inappropriate you talk about the

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.680
 consequences for if they continue the behavior and then you you you kick them I've seen a

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.800
 lot of users who sort of come forward or talk about it where they are the session host but

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.760
 they feel bad about maybe kicking or banning people because they don't want to cause strife

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.760
 or upset etc that's the sort of thing that we need to change like it also happens in

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.760
 in the real world there's whole sort of I think it's called like bystander training

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.240
 or something there's a whole name for it like green green dot or something I can't remember

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.880
 what it is it's basically like if and this is a horrible topic but let's say I don't

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:20.500
 know you're on a subway train and you see I don't know let's say someone being harassed

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:26.240
 in the corner like are you going to intervene with that and if you are going to intervene

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.040
 do you know how to intervene appropriately would other people on the train back you up

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.180
 not in a way where they're going to throw fists or anything but like would they back

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:40.440
 you up in the ways of sort of correctly de-escalating the situation and you know getting the person

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.080
 to safety etc would they and the answer is probably no and bystander training is the

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.720
 idea of trying to improve that situation there are a couple of updates that can be made to

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:55.300
 worlds to help things as well if you go into the permission system you can set the max

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.680
 scale and min scale they're currently set to a little bit of a weird number if you just

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:06.320
 raise those up and down a little bit that will help you can also set the full respawn

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.160
 position to a little bit higher that will also help because that means that when people

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.720
 do fall off terrain they won't spend forever falling they'll just fall for a little bit

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.520
 and then immediately respawn so it minimizes them for time where they're disturbed there's

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.880
 probably like other stuff you can do in the character controller to like limit the velocity

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:30.800
 of people like globally I know that you'll be able to do it with the the locomotion modifiers

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.480
 that I've seen that I did that big world on it is a difficult problem and like it's it's

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.600
 not like I'm asking you guys to solve it and we won't like trust me like I want to solve

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.600
 it I want to like provide as many tools as possible to solve it it's just we are currently

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.400
 stuck in that situation where we can't there's a particular variant of the bystander training

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:54.040
 I just can't like it's something like green green light green dot it was all sort of like

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.720
 trying to sort of like change the mindset from sort of like that isn't happening I should

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.240
 ignore it into I am an active participant in this event and it's on me to try and do

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.340
 something or something like that green dot find standard intervention training that's

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:14.020
 the one yeah there we go Specs has an amazing statement which I'll read we are leaving off

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:18.920
 so please drop down the level of questions I'm trying to wrap things up here now but

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.520
 Specs says confrontation can be scary most time people will listen I've had people quite

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.080
 firmly hey please don't keep sporting noise color vomit 5000 or I'll have to kick you

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.920
 and they stop doing it do you remember when it turns when it comes to loading stuff as

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.240
 as grace's collide initialization route it was literally the first tutorial I did please

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:41.200
 go watch it you'll learn a lot about like paroms first tutorial and it tells you how

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.420
 to fix up your collisions so that you don't fall through the ground on load whilst I'm

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:52.360
 here because I came up in conversation at some point as well consider not spawning the

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:58.080
 hermit meter by the way the hermit meter for those who are not aware is a meter which gets

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.880
 the percentage of people in private worlds and it's an unhealthy metric that I don't

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.380
 think you should do what it does is it points a massive big finger at those people hiding

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:14.180
 in private worlds and says haha you're a problem and that isn't a healthy way to get them out

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:18.400
 of private sessions like if you want to get people out of private sessions you need to

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.560
 give them a reason to come out of private sessions and if the first thing they see when

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:27.680
 they come out of private sessions is people discussing people in private sessions it doesn't

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.840
 encourage them like it's basically just going like these people are a problem and when they

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.120
 come out of private sessions we're going to talk about them even though they've they've

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:41.300
 braved a public session it's it's just like it's it's the wrong way to do it like give

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:47.200
 them a reason encourage them and invite them very good specs you've won the sort of analogy

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:53.120
 award for today specs is if you've ever been told by parents or family oh so you've come

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.880
 out of your cave as an introvert you know how much that sucks good good good analogy

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.160
 uh yeah i'll speak to major about i didn't realize it was in the creator jam uh template

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.960
 like if you want a hermit meter flip it upside down have the non-hermit meter and then try

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.640
 and increase that it but like the number of people in public sessions right now the social

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:16.720
 meter the potential friends meter i'll go ahead and leave off there if you have any

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.080
 additional questions please feel free to dm me tag me send me pigeons whatever you want

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.000
 to do i will go ahead and answer them to the best of my ability i am starving i'm gonna

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.880
 go feed myself cheese will be involved
