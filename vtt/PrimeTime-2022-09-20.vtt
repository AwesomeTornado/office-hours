WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
So for those on the recording, I forgot to hit record for like half a minute, I'm sorry

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.440
for those hearing on the recording, please, please do forgive me.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.440
Let's get started with questions.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.600
Tronas asks, I haven't played a good RTS in like forever.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.800
I used to play Red Bullet 2 a lot with some friends, and my friend had this ability where

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.840
it was just sort of, I don't know, he spawned tanks, like some sort of insect or something.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.480
Tanks just appeared out of everywhere and I could never keep up.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.180
I don't like playing RTS games with other players, like I don't really like PvP games

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.700
in general, particularly with friends, and the reason behind that is someone is always

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.400
having a bad time when I play PvP, at least I find that.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.960
So someone is not doing well, and they're losing, and then therefore they are sad.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.960
And so I don't like that.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.520
So I tend to only play cooperative games.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.360
I can play with, you know, like player versus player games if there's a team, but if there's

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.800
a team, all the people I'm in communication with, all the people I'm playing with have

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.420
to be on the same team, otherwise I get a bit, I don't know, it just feels weird.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.040
Another RTS game which I really, really wish that someone would own and understand and

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.120
try and play with me, because I don't know, like no one plays the game and it's kind of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.840
weird, but I have a time traveling RTS game in my library.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.640
It is an RTS game where you can time travel, and it is insane.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.260
To list the sort of ways that time travel play out, you can do things, for example,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.140
build a tank creator, so a vehicle factory, spawn a tank, the tank comes out of the vehicle

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.120
factory, send the tank into the past before the tank was created, and explode the tank

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.200
factory.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.160
At that point, a regular game engine would just be like, what the hell is going on?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.580
But this particular time traveling RTS engine figures it out, and it will propagate what's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.640
called the grandfather paradox through the game until one of the states resolves sort

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.280
of randomly.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.740
The two states being the tank factory doesn't exist, or the tank doesn't exist, or both

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.040
don't exist, and it will figure it all out, and it's multiplayer as well, and so in a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.240
multiplayer game, you might be trying to do the usual red alert 2 style thing and build

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.240
up your base, but someone has time traveled their entire attack force back in time and

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.300
is attacking you before you had any units, so you always have to be sending units forwards

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.300
and backwards.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.300
Acron is the name of the game.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.040
It is incredibly confusing.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.480
I have not been able to win a match or even survive.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.760
It is painfully overcomplicated, yes, but it is very, I don't know, I want to learn

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.720
it, and it died, right, no one wants to play it, but I would love it if there had been

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.120
a little pro series, even if it was just a season, and then we'll be able to take a look

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.080
at pro players doing it.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.280
Similar to a game called Splitgate, Splitgate's an FPS game where you can make portals, similar

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280
to the game Portal.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.040
I think they originally called it like Portal Shooter or something, but they couldn't due

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.400
to branding and terms of trademarks, et cetera, but Splitgate you can portal, and the pro

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.960
players are just constantly portaling, and for Splitgate, I never portal, but Splitgate

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.080
is dead now as well, he does announce that they're not doing updates for anyone.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.720
Anyway, we should get back on track, we're four minutes in and we've just been talking

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.720
about video games that are not Neos, so let's go ahead and take a look at the next question.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.360
Waffler, the protogen, says, so I'm trying to make an avatar complete with a Neos, it

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.900
is made up of precisely placed boxes and such.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.880
I glue it together with a glue tool, but then rotating the thing makes it rotate around

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.000
the center of the world instead of its own center.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.760
Yeah, don't glue it, the glue tool is not the tool you want to use for that.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.240
There are a bunch of people inside Neos that do this activity, so speak to Rusty and Sloppy

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.280
McFloppy and they'll be able to help you out, they make avatars entirely inside Neos.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.080
Origins are very important, so don't glue them, manually pair them together and then

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.480
you won't lose those origin datas, datatars, datutus, daties, what's the plural of data?

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.080
I don't know.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.600
Anyway, Yoho asks, are there any cool things you can tell us about the work that's happening

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.840
while we wait for this Neos issue to take the time to pass?

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.840
No.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.520
Moving onwards, Waffler says, much more general question, I'm interested in being a world

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.200
creator and logic user, what other steps I should go through on this journey to be a

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.200
good creator in Neos?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200
Do it.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.320
I know that's a sort of brash and harsh answer, but that's the answer.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.480
So even the statement, I want to be a world creator, you are a world creator, Waffler,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.720
I know that you haven't built a world yet, but you are a world creator, there isn't really

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.840
anything that you need to do to become a world creator except to do it.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.320
There are a bunch of tutorials on my channel and a few other channels that will get you

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.840
started with world creation, I have a full world creation series, it is a little bit

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.320
on the old side now, uses the old UI, but still should be mappable to the new UI, so

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.240
go ahead and take a look at that.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.000
My advice is start small, in that series we make a world, we put a picnic table and some

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.800
trees in and we save it, and that just gets you around the loader world, add something

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.500
to the world, save the world, teach you to do that.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.760
As for logics, I don't have a beginner logics tutorial, I do need to fill that gap at some

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.040
point, but Basement Node has a really good one, and then once you do know logic, I have

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.280
a lot more sort of how to create specific thing tutorials.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.160
Its original name was Puddle Wars or something, they are not, Splitgate is not doing updates,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.320
they released their final update recently, and they are no longer doing updates.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.240
They'll do like bug fixes or exploit fixes, but they're not doing any more content.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.280
What's annoying is the cash shop is still up, so they'll still be doing cash stuff.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.440
You know, you can still buy whatever their equivalent of e-books is.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.320
Splitgate coins or something like that, I don't know, who knows.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.080
Split coins, says Aaron.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.660
Thank you Mr. Aaron.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.320
With that, all of the questions have been answered, that we currently have, so if you

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.560
have any more questions, do get them typed up, otherwise we're going to sit here in unimaginable

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.560
silence.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.920
I'll just scroll up and down the list looking for any questions I might have missed.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.480
There are no questions which I have missed.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.920
Are there any other Neos tutorial channels you would like to add to the list?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:18.320
Uh, yeah, there's actually a bunch, so Basement Node is doing a bunch now, even June is.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.160
Check the tutorials channel and scroll up recently, like I haven't posted that much

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.720
because I've been away for a bit, but you'll see Paddy done one, doesn't sound like a correct

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720
sentence.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.040
Paddy did one, I think they've done a couple.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:40.800
And then, this is exactly what I was looking for, is Alex from Alaska has this amazing

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.400
list which does need translating, so if you are not technical, please wait for someone

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.360
slightly more technical to translate it.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.000
But this list here is a list of playlist IDs, and you can put those into YouTube by just

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.280
expanding the URL a little bit, and that will get you to tutorial channels that do exist.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:10.080
So yeah, me, Jax did a few back in the day, Fruxy of course has a lot, Coffee, Turk, Circuitry,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.880
even Alex has done a few, June, NG, Nicole did a few, I forgot Nicole did a few, of course

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.880
that's great.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.640
And then Svekin did a bunch as well, I like those ones.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.720
I love this question from Rock and Nook, because it's sometimes difficult to speak about.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.760
I am not aware of what the Quest Pro is, now of course I am, I've seen the leaks, but as

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.160
a company we can't do anything about the leaks.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.320
For us to make, integrate new hardware, we need the hardware to be released and given

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.140
to us in some form.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.240
Now in some cases I'm happy buying the hardware and just integrating it, but if it's not out

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.520
yet, we don't have any plans, it needs to be out before we have plans.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.760
The general statement on hardware though is that we'll try and integrate as much as we

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.120
can, it does depend on development priorities, hashtag announcements, and like the actual

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.600
hardware itself.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.720
For example the HP Omnicept, whatchamacallit2, has a mouth tracking camera, but it only provides

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.880
a black and white camera feed, it doesn't do any of the AI that the HTC face tracker

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.840
does which converts those mouth movements into actual data we can use.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:28.380
So if we wanted to use the HP Doodaddy, we would have to write our own AI, which is something

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.080
that we probably wouldn't want to do, because at that point we have to maintain it and we

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.440
turn it into basically machine and learning engineers, which is a very complicated Doodaddy

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.440
to do.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:44.160
So once the Quest 2 Pro is officially released and has information about how developers can

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:51.240
access it, and has developer documentation or integration, then we can go ahead and take

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.860
a look at it.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:58.560
Same goes with any hardware, if you read on the bus in a newspaper, LEAK, amazing headset

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.680
costs 50 bucks, does everything, works as well as a Quest Pro and an Index all combined

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.160
into one, and it's got a battery and it lasts infinity.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.160
It's useless to us until there's actually in our hands details about it out in the world

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160
that are not leaked.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.200
Right, moving onwards, I've got a long question here, I will read it out for the purposes

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.520
of the recording from Zygmuntz.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.000
Zygmuntz says, many users have voiced concern about the state of Neos and the uncertainty

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.520
of its future, with tentative inte-te-te, with tentative inte-te, I'll get through that,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.500
with tentative interest in continuing to use the platform as normal despite the closed

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.680
nature of ongoing negotiations behind the scenes, I and some others have unfortunately

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.520
been met with much resistance getting news of something on the platform, not only due

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:47.560
to obvious UX issues, but also the observance of dismissive and sometimes overtly rude behaviour

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.400
of Neos mentors, moderators and Neos team members when addressing these other concerns

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.840
directly, including yourself, oh no, what message can you give to potential Neos players

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.880
to give them hope the platform is in good hands and to give them a platform chance to,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.960
right, the top-down opacity of the current situation, I don't know, we are doing our

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:12.080
best to exist in this current scenario, we don't have any additional news about that,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.880
if you have any complaints about the behaviour of mentors, moderators and the Neos team members,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.960
please feel free to file a moderation ticket, I will move on.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.760
Tiki, is there a quick way to layer a second emissive texture to a zyxy material, like

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:30.920
pile up another material on top, if I have a texture as a pen apparent, you might have

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.040
to add another mesh renderer to do that to like material stack things, I'd have to look

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.920
at the zyxy one again, no, like material stack in the good way, not the bad way, if you duplicate

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.160
the mesh renderer and add a different material to the mesh renderer, that's okay, if you

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.240
put another material on top of the same material in the same mesh renderer, that's material

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.540
stacking, which is on the things to avoid list, has asks, I know this isn't really supported,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.920
but I heard you could possibly do cloud spawning with our record URLs, Neos rec, Neos DB links,

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.240
which is apparently better, I don't support cloud spawning because it's on the things

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.680
to avoid list, so I won't be answering that, however, Neos rec, Neos DB, we don't care,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.720
neither of them are better, so if you do it with one, you do it with the other one, as

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:20.120
it's an unsupported feature, I can't provide support, you can check the things to avoid

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.560
list for that.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.760
Anadiya says, since we spoke about the facial tracker, do you know if the vive focus 3 facial

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.840
tracker has the idea to work with Neos or does it work, I don't know, because it's vive

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:37.440
stroke htc, it might use the same library, I don't know, I haven't looked into it yet,

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.120
when new hardware comes out, it takes a little bit to take a look at, so Zlinka says that

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.320
they have information that they're dropping sr-anypal, which is great, because I don't

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.080
like sr-anypal, and they'll use some other format, so that will take longer to integrate,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.800
and of course, because the current stuffs, we can't integrate, so we'll take a look at

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.200
it when we can take a look at it.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.520
Let's make sure there's a github issue open with this new hardware coming out.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.920
If the hardware is released and you would like to see it integrated, please make one

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.120
github issue, please don't make 17 for the same headset, but maybe collate with some

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.920
other people that are interested in it, or if you have your hands on it, let me know.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.660
For example, I have the EttVR controllers coming, I preordered them back when I had

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.360
an opinion on them, and it's got to the point where it's like, what are those preorders

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.680
where I just want them, like I don't even care if they're good at this point, I just

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.680
want them.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.880
I stopped subscribing to any kickstarters for that same reason, it was just like, at

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.080
the time I back a kickstarter project, I like it, and by the time it arrives, I've almost

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.920
forgotten what it even is, but seeing as I do have eddy controllers arriving at some

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:46.440
point in the future, I will get those up to date and integrated, because they'll be in

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.000
my hands.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.040
It's not, like, it's not Eddy's fault, they've had to contend with the pandemic and also

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:01.400
some circuit board shortage, not circuit board shortage, component shortage that occurs over

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.400
in China.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.280
They also had some quality issues with their manufacturers, they had to swap to a different

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.320
manufacturer, I mean, keeping eye on that.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.400
If there's a standard, that's great, Link, as well, they've updated their link to have

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.640
the Cronus OpenXR standard for face tracking, which is great.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.240
Moving forwards, Neosmotic says, is there any government to help users optimize worlds

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.240
in Neosmotic?

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.760
There is not an official guide, there is a wiki page that was written, I don't remember

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.960
if I wrote it or some other people did, I could look at the history, but I was on a

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.400
plane when I found it the other day.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:43.480
But that's usually for avatars, but it does have some hints that might help.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:50.440
I could go through, like, a bunch, but I would be missing a bunch, so don't take anything

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:55.040
I say as sort of, like, gospel, I actually don't know where I'd even start, I'll have

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:01.320
to pass on that one and collect my thoughts and actually do a video update that page to

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.040
include some map or world information.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.160
And then, Neosmotic also asks about screen sharing, are there any hacks available to

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.680
get screen sharing working in Neosmotic?

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:18.280
I would use the coco.live that the Japanese community are using a lot, that makes it really

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.280
easy to do.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.800
I think it's in one of their folders, I'll get you the tweet, I know I can find the tweet,

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.960
and if anyone knows the folder, they can go ahead and post that down, is it coco or kovo

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.960
or k-something?

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.760
That's probably the easiest way to do it right now.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:38.360
Yeah, delay's gonna be a thing, strangely I'm a little bit of an expert in video streaming,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.440
for historical reasons, how?

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.760
Anyway, yeah, coco, it would be my recommendation simply for ease of use right now.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:52.880
Moving forwards to harmonica-fennacat, is there any way to check the cloud storage that

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.280
we have used up, as in knowing what's using up the storage space?

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.100
Yes, there are a bunch of commands you can use, they are on the Neos bot command, I just

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:05.440
typed bepis instead of Neos, I have no idea why, into my search to find this bot page.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.360
Neos bot, Neos wiki, that should get me out.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.360
Okay.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.280
So there is the request usage report, ah yes, I think it's got me covered there, so I type

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.080
in bepis, which I know is like a meme phrase, I didn't intend to type bepis, and sometimes

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.680
the keyboard just explodes with stuff that doesn't make any sense.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.800
Moving forwards to iMarin's question says, speaking of new VR stuff, what's an upcoming

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.000
VR thing, physical or not, that you're very most excited for?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.440
I'm excited to see this next generation of headsets and sort of innovation that exists,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.080
I'm liking the fact that all of the headsets coming out now don't have Vive ones, I still

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.680
have no idea what Vive were thinking when they made the Vive ones, I've used them a

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:51.160
couple of times and hated them, I think that Vive ones probably actually put VR back like

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.900
maybe a year, maybe six months in terms of design simply by existing, and they will also

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:01.020
have some inertia as VR continues to improve from people that like the ones, or have only

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:09.760
used the ones to play VR, and now suddenly have to use a more regular controller, I know

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:15.720
some people like them, if you like them, nothing against you, but seriously, try some other

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.720
controllers.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.160
Now I get the index controllers are basically a piece of cardboard, if you look at them

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:27.840
they'll fall apart, but look at every other headset that exists does not use giant donut

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:35.200
stick controllers, yeah I don't want the sword controllers either, I did see the PS PlayStation

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.680
VR 2 controllers the other day, because I was watching a video about them, and they

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:46.880
look kind of identical to the Quest controllers except they'd added more guards, it almost

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:53.600
looked like again a sword, but wasn't a sword, it's probably better tracking fidelity because

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.440
the additional plastic on those, the electronic says Vive needs to share whatever they were

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:04.360
on when making those, I can tell you, so when Vive originally made the VR headset they were

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:10.760
thinking more about business and educational uses, where a pointing device similar to what

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.960
you would point at for like a PowerPoint presentation made more sense, it seems odd as a sort of

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.440
random anecdote, but like that's what these office hours turn into sometimes, I was watching

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:27.000
a documentary about megastructures and how they were built, and it was a documentary

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.240
about how they laid a pipeline from I think it was Norway down to the UK for natural gas,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.080
and I was just watching it and like fascinated about how they were doing it from an engineering

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:42.720
perspective, and then there was a guy in a cave system holding something similar to a

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.800
Vive wand, now when I say cave someone's like a cave, like cave is an earlier version of

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.800
virtual reality where you kind of go into a room and it projects on all walls and so

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.600
you feel like you're in the room, it's called CAVE, it stands for something, it's an abbreviation

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.960
I don't know, I'll get you a picture so you can understand why the hell I'm repeatedly

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:07.580
saying the word cave, like it makes sense, it does if you know what it is, I just Google

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:13.600
image search cave system and got lots of pictures of cave, of caves, I don't want a picture

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:22.280
of a cave, there's a cave system, so it's basically like a cube map that you stand in

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:31.000
and then you point, and the person was using that as a tool to figure out the route for

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.800
the undersea pipe, it was like amazing documentary, I'll try and link it, I watched it late at

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.600
night and I was just sort of blown away by like how complicated that was, I knew that

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.480
pipelines existed, I just didn't know there were A so many and B that it was so complicated,

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.360
as an example here there is a pipe laying ship, and there's only three of them in the

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.320
world, and so if you want a pipeline laid in water you need one of the pipeline ships

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.800
and there are three, and they will load segments on, I don't know how long they are, let's

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.280
just say they're 20 minutes long, they will weld the segments to the pipeline as they're

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.920
coming off the back of the ship, so it's almost like, similar to a spider, I was gonna say

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.760
similar to pooping but that's kind of gross, similar to a spider, it's generating as it's

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.720
going and just like pulling pipe out of its back whilst it's welding them, it's crazy,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.720
anyway they were planning that with a cave system and it was using a pointing device

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:31.600
and that reminded me, gadgets are fun yo, let's move forwards, Fecken says, so I think

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.680
Neos can import HDR textures but does Neo support HDR displays work in HDR, I don't

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.240
know, it's kind of a graphics-y rendering question which I'm not very good at, mostly

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:52.040
because of the color-blind-ish, so I think the better question there is to ask what headset

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.880
or display you're talking about and then we can take a look, we do have HDR in the color

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.920
spaces etc, but I don't know depending on which display you mean, alright next, actually

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:08.760
do I miss any more, we've got Cocoa, yes, Colza sums it up, Vibe ones were fine for

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.800
one of the first VR systems, agreed, but everyone decided a better direction and Vibe just kept

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.920
selling them, yep, they just kept selling them, they did try I guess with the Cosmos

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.400
controllers, you know the ones that look like the tribal Gameboy SP that everyone had, but

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.460
those are just eight batteries, I remember speaking to Engie about that, they're just

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.200
eight batteries, Lex says there are multiple questions, these tangents are getting out

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.800
of hand, you think, nah, it's my office hours, I'll tangent as much as I like, I'm still

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.640
staying over the time, we've still got four minutes and we'll probably get through them.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.040
Alright, moving forwards to Zigman's follow up question, file moderation ticket has been

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.480
considered in multiple times to be a cop-out answer to this question, are there any comments

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.040
you can provide to hesitant new users beyond immediately filing complaint to existing users

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.560
concerned about this as well, especially after reserving conversion rate after the VRCEAC

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.800
update, so the file moderation ticket is not a cop-out, the file moderation ticket is,

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.520
if you have behaviour that you don't like, it is inappropriate to talk about it in a

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.640
public setting, and so file moderation ticket isn't a cop-out, it takes that behavioural

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.360
complaint to the appropriate authorities who can then enact on that, I'll also take behavioural

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.160
complaints in direct messages, but if they are about players inside NES, I need them

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.600
to be a ticket, that is just a thing that occurs at companies, you go to any company,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.840
any sort of behavioural based thing, rural breachy thing, needs to either go in modmail,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.240
go to a popular community, let's just say path of exile community, everything there

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.280
is done through modmail, take any popular reddit, it's all done through modmail over

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.560
there, and the reason is you take it out of the public eye, it's just standard operating

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.920
procedure for many things, if there is a problem with behaviour, we take it to a moderation

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.240
system, it's not a cop-out, it's just what needs to happen.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.400
Are there any comments you could provide to hesitant users beyond immediately filing complaint,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.560
if the first thing that a new user needs to do is to file a complaint, then something's

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.220
wrong there, I'm not quite understanding what's going on there, I see new users coming in

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.800
all the time, they seem to love us, we do lose users after the YALC update, and I knew

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.160
that that would happen, they came, they checked us out, we're a bit like broken and rusty

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.120
right now, and then they went elsewhere, they went where their friends are, that's totally

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.760
fine, I'm going to read your original question again Zygmund, one second, so the behaviour

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.200
might just be because what we have is a lot of users just poking and prodding at us, and

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.640
there's really nothing we can say, if we want to say something, we'll say it, but there's

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.480
nothing that we can say, I could give you a blow-by-blow of every single message that

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.040
I have received from anyone in the internal team about this dispute, but it wouldn't do

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:39.280
any good, there's nothing that is a good announcement, and so therefore following, again, common

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.280
PR stuff that you'll find at any company, which we sometimes do lax on, because we let

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.280
information go, or we give more information than we should, we're doing the right thing,

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:54.200
and if you don't like that, then you don't like the public relations community or industry,

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.920
and that's unfortunate, but it's a way to just keep it going, I don't know, do you want

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:08.840
like an egg timer, or like a pie chart, or like a countdown, I can't give you any information,

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.160
like there's no information, the moment I can give you information, I'll give you information,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.640
until then there is none, do we have any additional questions in the office hours text chat?

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.520
That's a better question, actually, let me take a look at, make sure I'm not missing

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.280
any questions, Linker says, will you give me new shader processing back on asset variation

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.040
side so I can make funny material orbs in the future, maybe exception to plugins if

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:38.000
they have been loaded, no, sorry, we really cannot have custom shaders, if you can get

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.920
them to work for the plugin, fantastic, but we can't do any work that would allow them

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:49.160
even if it's full of plugins, because they will simply just break, they will break.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:55.840
And while the Neos Plus community may understand the implications there, some random user that

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.120
you set up with a custom shader on Neos Plus and then suddenly Neos Plus doesn't work,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:05.800
they won't understand in the future, and they'll probably misdirect their anger towards the

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:11.560
Neos community and the Neos team, and they'll say things like, I know that you said that

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:16.920
this is going to break, and now it's broken, but it's broken and I'm still mad, and that's

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:22.240
a problem, and so we kind of need to mitigate that a bit, it is problematic, it is sad,

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:28.200
but like, we're trying to protect you, I don't know why it popped into my head, but you know,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.400
Undertale popped into my head there, you know, and Toriel's trying to protect you from going

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:37.520
into the rest of the game, they're like, no, stay here, it's nice here, it's not an apt

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.920
analogy because, you know, through that door would be full custom shaders, I do get the

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.040
complaints that I do understand, it's just like, it would be a, it's a lesser of two

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.680
evils to block it on the server side, basically.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.840
Moving forward to Zigman's additional question, thank you for rephrasing this one, the question

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.660
was less about the behavior and more about the reassurance and the belief that Neos is

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.360
changing, adapting and moving to the future.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.280
We are moving into the future as best as we can, negotiations are ongoing between Carol's

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.720
and Fritz's side of the things, there's stuff going on behind the scenes, we have nothing

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.460
to share on that because we are taking the recommendations to not share what's going

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.440
on, mostly from various people that are telling us not to.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.040
If Neos was not changing, adapting and moving into the future, I would not be here every

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.700
week except for the past two weeks answering your guys' questions.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.440
I don't know how else to reassure you of this fact.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.760
I think, yes, I know it hurts and I know it's sad, but it's actually going to happen a

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.120
bunch of times with all aspects of Neos.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.480
You'll discover something and then it will suddenly not work.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.680
If you look at the issues I've been making on Neos Public, you'll see examples of that

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.680
everywhere.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:51.000
For example, the slice shader that goes through 3D volumes like MRI data, that has to work

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.680
with a uniform unit cube, it cannot work with anything that is long, which is really annoying

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.760
because most CTs and MRIs that we've had are sort of cubular things like the upper chest,

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:10.280
the head, those are regular shapes, they're approximately a cube, but I have a CT scan

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.720
of an entire body, where of course the length is greater than the width, and we had to do

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.600
some really hacky stuff there.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.160
And that is not only a limitation of the Neo source code, it's a limitation of the shader

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.160
as well.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.800
I looked at the shader code and got really scared, it's sort of re-marched, so it needs

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.080
a lot of updating to work with non-uniform-ness-ness.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.480
It's just going to keep happening though, unfortunately.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.840
If you're looking at integrating a Wii scale, I would sure go for it.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.840
People still have those.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.600
In fact, actually I predict that there is a bunch of houses around the world that have

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.240
got Wii scales from Wii Fit, just sort of tucked under their TV stand, and they've been

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.880
there for years and they're gathering dust.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.880
That's where mine used to go.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.780
You know, it's sort of like, oh, you used it, and then you tuck it underneath the TV

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.040
stand and it gathers dust.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.900
Is it under a TV stand though, Stifle?

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.040
When my mother had a Wii, um, strange phrase, when my mother had a Wii, when my mother got

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.960
her Wii, she lost a lot of weight on that, it was great, it was really, really good.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.960
And then she stopped playing.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.360
She didn't put back on the weight, she kept it off, but you know, she was up there all

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.360
the time.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.480
Vturexulus says, will there be cake after office hours?

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.280
Unfortunately I don't have cake, I also don't have cheese, I should probably go grocery

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.280
shopping after this.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.800
With that, there are no additional questions though, so rather than talking about Wii scales

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.560
for the rest of the evening, I'm going to go ahead and leave off here.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.760
If you have any additional questions, feel free to direct message me, post in the questions

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.800
and help section, I'll take a look at the various YouTube channels, etc.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.120
I will get back to you next week, I know there was a break for two weeks, I was away, but

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:59.800
we'll be back for the weekly office hours, and enjoy!
