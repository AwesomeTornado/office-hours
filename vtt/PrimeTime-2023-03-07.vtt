00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
 Welcome to office hours. We're gonna go ahead and get started. This is the weekly air-mayor section where I ask questions about Nios

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.980
 So if you have any questions about Nios, please drop them in the office hours text chat

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.380
 And I will go ahead and get them answered

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.240
 I'm just gonna go ahead and ping the office hours roll again so people know that we're here

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.380
 It does take people like I don't know ten minutes to arrive. It's like seven people right now

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.280
 Thank you so much those seven people for being here. We get to like 20 past. It's like 20 people. It's strange

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.840
 But there we go

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.560
 Try to keep this at the same time every single week for as long as possible

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.860
 Just so people think of it like a TV show. So we have one question right now from specs this question

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.080
 I'm going to delay reading just for a little bit whilst I open up the code base

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.320
 Excuse me. Oh, it's because I checked out a branch yesterday

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.120
 I tried to open Visual Studio Visual Studio and can't find that solution file. It's like oh, yeah, I'm on a branch one second

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 I'll read the question whilst the code base is loading that takes a while anyone who's opened a Visual Studio project, you know

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.840
 It's just like oh, yes

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.600
 I'm gonna spin your computer fans up as loud as they will go just to read some text files because that's Visual Studio for you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.440
 So specs this question is

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.740
 Do wigglers or and wobblers and other components that run on T incur much in the way of network traffic or do they basically run locally?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.720
 Masking from matter how much how many might be too many in a world surprised to find how many we could sit you without seeing

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.080
 Which impact so I know that spinner for example runs locally and that's why

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960
 Spinners can actually desync for various people

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.720
 So spinners are really only good for what I call sort of visual animations rather than sort of functional animations

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.580
 What I mean by that is let's say you're in a wizard study as a part of an RPG game

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.400
 And there's one of those like mobile, you know small planetariums in the corner

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.780
 If those planets on that planetarium are running on a spinner, that's probably okay, right?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.760
 Because it's just there to add ambience to the to the scene. It's not there to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.560
 Do anything functional so you people being desync is totally fine with that. It's just a you know background piece of art

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.920
 If however that wasn't a planetarium and instead it was actually like a solar system and you're making a space game where you fly between

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.240
 Planets using a spaceship you wouldn't be able to use spinner in that case because the planet might be in a completely different

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.520
 Location for half the crew of your ship which would kind of be a deal breaker

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.820
 So there you go. There's the difference on spinner at least now the code base is open and responding to control T requests

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.820
 I can go ahead and look at wobbler

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.920
 Yeah, so wobble is also local so local drive

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.400
 And the same with wiggler. We'll go wiggle and wobble

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.720
 Almost said what what what would too many w words wobble and wiggle do not sync any data

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.460
 Other than their settings if you change the speed the magnitude etc those will sync

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.240
 The actual state does not sync so again

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.980
 they are used for local effects like I mentioned the difference between the model planetarium and a wizard's office and the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.540
 Space game where you're flying between planets, and that's why you can get away with quite a lot of them

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.160
 But do you remember that they don't sync?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.220
 Moving forwards to the next question has been difficult to manage the development of multiple versions of Nia since you've said in the past you

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.000
 Have quite a few things were pretty much ready for an update and there's also small update required like the one we had

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.560
 But they score is it difficult to track all that considering how large the project is it get get is very good at that

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.180
 In some cases get isn't like I just had

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.560
 I don't know why but because I had a branch checked out the shortcut file

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.760
 I usually used to launch the solution didn't work for some reason

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.800
 Occasionally I have to remake that shortcut file. I don't really understand why but whatever

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.620
 Other than that it's good. There are some cases where like mergers are problematic a good example of this that has been in public before so

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.900
 It's you know

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.200
 Do you know about it already is color management in color management?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.400
 We introduced a new data type color X which I believe you can still see inside Neos right now. It's just not finished

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.400
 Don't use it. Don't use it

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.440
 But it's there inside the code base

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.280
 When we are trying to make the full cut over to color management every version of color in our code base

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.320
 needs to turn to color X

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.000
 And so while that is only a one character change just imagine everywhere

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.920
 Why color is used as a good example there the delete button the default inspector is red and the reason why it's red is

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.500
 Because someone has typed the word color dot red at some point in the code base that needs to be color X dot red

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.820
 And so what that leads to sometimes is a lot of merge conflicts particularly when?

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:38.180
 You know the color management build is is you know trying to desperately stay up to date with anything else for the video

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.640
 It's that question, but get pick is designed to be there. I'm still trying to teach members of the team

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.640
 How get works etc for example?

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.020
 If you are one of the people who commits to get with the git commit message of update I will

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.260
 Do the leader Liam?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.140
 Who's the guy that plays the wanted guy?

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.360
 No, no that's wanted the movie of bending bullets

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.660
 I want the one I was a new one he played memory Liam Neeson. Yeah, Liam Neeson

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.780
 You know he plays the same person in every single film. He's the guy who gets stuff done

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.300
 Taken is the film that I was

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.020
 Referring to that's the mean

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.640
 Yeah, so if you

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.940
 Get commits that was it yeah, if you use git commits with just a simple of like update

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.480
 I will find you and I will kill you

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.080
 Git commit should describe the change there is no such thing as a

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.900
 Too long and get commit you should keep the first line of the git commit very short

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.820
 But you can push enter and then type an essay and git will just handle it

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.600
 It's beautiful when you do that because people have context about why you made that change

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.560
 And then you don't do something like at 3 a.m.. Go why did

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.000
 Bob who isn't at work today because they're on vacation

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.000
 Why did he make this change because it just broke everything sure you doing that and then secondarily don't commit commented out code

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.960
 You need to comment something out, and you think you might use it later

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.820
 you should wrap it in a configuration block or a build flag or you should delete it and

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.940
 Leave a reference somewhere in your own personal notes about where you can find it in the git tree if you don't have personal notes

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.380
 Without your code then I don't know what you doing

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.140
 I just like keep notes for everything like I was setting up the MMC voting server for this year

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.900
 And I had no idea how it worked

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.220
 I completely forgot everything because I didn't make notes so I have made notes and I know how it works

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.420
 And I'll know how it works next year. Oh, it's an interesting question

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.020
 They say what is a part of Neos that you wish you understood better?

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:50.040
 I understood the actual like lower level data stuff the synchronization for anyone who's written a plug-in or a mod

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.720
 Maybe you'll understand that the majority of fields that do synchronize in Neos are just called what are called sinks

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.140
 Sink and then not sink the kitchen sink sinkers in to sink synchronize

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.880
 if you make something a sink it will just

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.380
 Magically appear on everyone's computer, and I have no real idea how or why because I don't really need to touch it

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.640
 I wish understood that more simply because if there are problems of it

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.160
 Which there are I could go ahead and fix them if that questions answered moving forwards to Riggs question

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.700
 Riggs says well the new Neos have

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.700
 Different collision physics than the current build asks because I'm trying to make a pool of table

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.260
 I don't know what you mean by a new Neos, so we do have an item on our roadmap

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.060
 rigid body physics and rigid body physics will enable you to

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:45.380
 Make things like a pool table that isn't spotted right now. It's not like a physics system or anything to do with collisions

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.320
 It's just an unsupported feature. Yes

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.280
 You'll be able to do stuff like that in fact a pool table is actually like a really good example of the difference between

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.920
 Rigid body physics and what we currently have what we currently have is character physics

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.400
 Which is hey I can jump in the world and I don't fall through the floor

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:05.040
 Which you can sort of coerce into making balls and stuff that you can throw around

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.640
 But it's difficult laggy etc. And there's a huge warning when you do that like literally built into the inspector

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.560
 That won't be the case when we have rigid body physics if you like more information on rigid body physics

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.440
 Take a look at the character controller component inside the game

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.760
 Which has a list of you know talks all about it or take a look at the issue

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.380
 Which is reference from that character controller component or just search for rigid body physics

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:34.480
 Okay, moving forwards to Lex's question. What is the timeout for certain network related actions for example?

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.860
 How long it takes to automatically get set offline when you crash or how long it takes for a session to disappear off the session

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.120
 This one you crash. I'd have to look up each of those in turn

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.680
 Because they're they're probably different

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.980
 Some of them might just be sort of a function of other matters as well. For example the session lister

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.620
 I know that that has a couple of update mechanisms

00:08:54.620 --> 00:09:00.140
 So there's the update mechanism that occurs on our end as in the cloud and then there's the update mechanism that happens

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.360
 on your end, which is periodically your world browser will

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:12.540
 Ask the server for new sessions, and so if those don't sync up exactly like a sort of weird orchestra

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.860
 Then things that aren't valid might be there. The breaking questions

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.620
 I'm going to mute and slurp and humongous amount of coffee. Okay, that was half a pint of coffee

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:27.100
 I should be good to go now. Why are there two threads? Oh someone speaking the thread from February

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:33.520
 Let's go ahead and lock that thread. I will answer the question. It's our fault if it's confusing, but I'll go ahead and lock that one

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.500
 So Rico says will near support non humanoid avatars from the VR chat depends what you mean by non humanoid

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.420
 I think that due to a certain population on our platform will probably look into

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.120
 different leg types at some point

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.300
 If you mean things like spiders quadrupeds

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.820
 Any millipedes probably not millipedes, but you know well

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.660
 I think you're probably asking there for is more generic IK which is a feature that we're interested in

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:08.980
 So for those who aren't aware IK and also FK aren't just things are used for avatars or

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.200
 You know moving arms or whatever inside of

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:18.880
 In you know inside video games they're used for the actual fully definite process of those

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.700
 Which is inverse kinematics or forward kinematics if you don't understand what kinematics are

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:29.500
 I want you to think about the cup of water glass soda, whatever it is on your desk that you're drinking

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:35.540
 Hopefully you've got a drink on your desk and what you think about you picking up and drinking them the fact that your body

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:41.060
 Knows the sequence of muscles to pull and push to make that happen

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.180
 automatically is

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:51.180
 Forward kinematics that's like where you you know where stuff needs to be and so you you know

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.380
 Just you adjust stuff until it works that way so it comes up in a lot of stuff

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.060
 It comes up in a good example being of like generic IK would be like a robot arm

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.520
 So you think about a factory where robot arms may be?

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.500
 Lifting a piece into place someone I always think about as a car manufacturing line

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.860
 You know when they take like half the car and this robot arm goes like

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:15.340
 Like sucks it to the other side of the car yeah that needs kinematics

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.080
 So you know where the robot arm is in space that the human body just knows that is is amazing

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.080
 We don't really understand how it works

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.540
 Everyone's now sort of waving their arms around and thinking about it next question here from Ozi who says

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.620
 Not sure how to phrase this right, but how odd is the facial tracking implementation for Nia's?

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.700
 It seems like the facial tracking software is well buggy horrible and annoying so imagine for Nia's is trying its best

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.900
 You have to remember that do everything through a layer

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.420
 so we do

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.660
 Device integration, and then we do what we sort of like

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.080
 I don't know if it's literally called this but in my head like sanitization and conversion

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.540
 So we take the data that the device gives us we sanitize it and we convert it into data which Nia's

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.300
 Understands and then we blast it out there in Nia's functionality

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.400
 And that's the biggest example of this that doesn't actually make sense to be integrated

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.460
 But is integrated right now is that for haptic systems?

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:12.200
 We support both the be haptic suit and the oboe suit if anyone who doesn't know what the o suit is good

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:19.360
 It's a alternative haptic base suit which requires sticky gel to be affixed to your skin via a tight jacket

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.260
 It looks interesting

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.940
 But I don't know if I want to get naked and sticky with the lads just to have some haptic feedback

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:31.200
 The point there being both of those systems work and have vastly different API's

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.620
 But they come out the same as the haptic components inside of Nia's

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.300
 We want to make that sort of first part like the device integration layer

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:45.880
 We want to make that open to you guys to write plugins is the wrong word because everyone goes like but then I can't join other

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:51.100
 People we want to make it so you can join other people and you'll be able to write your own device integrators

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.100
 So if you make a headset in your bedroom

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.560
 using a workbench and you know an Arduino ever you'd be able to

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:06.760
 Integrate it into our systems and it would pretend from the view of other people in the session that you are just wearing a regular

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.400
 Headset because that would stop the sort of arms race. It's not arms race is the wrong word

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.720
 But you know, I mean like we have when a new device comes out

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.780
 Well, I mean my arms race which is the wrong word, but I'll run with it is that you know

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.440
 New headset comes out does VR chat support it does

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:29.400
 Rec room support it does roblox support it does meta horizon support it does neo support it and the answer to those questions is

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.960
 the first person to support it usually gets like a

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.440
 Boost because they're like, yeah, we support it blah blah blah

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.920
 moving on to additional questions

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.280
 Alex says what did I miss what you can do the recording?

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.920
 There's also a transcription available which does stress out my computer, which is why it sometimes takes a while

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.960
 It's like ah VR platform developer is slow on AI thing. Yay

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.480
 I need like more computers

00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:01.500
 I know that it's the stereotypical thing for people who work in the tech sector like me in this area to have like server racks in

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.480
 Their houses or something so many people I know have just got like a full server rack in their house

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:11.600
 And they're just like, oh, yes, I could process this transcription through my server rack. I don't I used to it's off

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.600
 It's the tree. It's been I shipped it from the UK where I lived

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.080
 To Germany where I live for 18 months

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.600
 I didn't turn it on and then I shipped it to America and I still haven't got it turned on

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.000
 There's actually still packing tape on it from when I moved in here five years ago

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.960
 It's not even really a server. It's just a tiny box that can do what I want to

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.720
 But yeah, there will be a transcription and there will be a recording

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.020
 Alex then extends this question with talked about Nia's future. We have not talked about Nia's future

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.380
 If you like to ask a question, please go ahead and do so moving on to the next question

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:49.000
 Riggs says full body locking to hip or head feature possibly on the horizon. I'm used this might be a thing

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.280
 I seem to be hip-locked

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:50.760
 Ah, yeah

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.960
 So there is a large collection of issues to do with IK particularly when it comes to full body tracking

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:01.220
 That we want to look at and improve. Frix is quite sure of what he needs to do there, though

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.020
 He just needs to you know, have the time and capability to do it. He spends a lot of time in full body understanding

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.600
 What's going on there?

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.660
 We get it's problematic. We're just there's nothing we can do about it right now. There's a bunch of changes there

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.640
 Erin asked what's the difference between forward and inverse kinematics?

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:22.600
 I've had a forward kinematics before so inverse is you take the end position and you figure out the joints going backwards

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.980
 So in the case of a robot arm, you would take the position of the clasper

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.380
 You know the grabby bit at the end of the arm and you would work backwards from the grabber to figure out

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.120
 Where the joints of the arm need to be to make sure that that grabber is there?

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.840
 Whereas forward kinematics is the other way around you start at the top and you are down

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.620
 I don't know much about it, but I presume like inverse is more

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.500
 Easy to wrap your head around because you're like, yeah

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.840
 I want I want the grasp or of my arm to be here

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.480
 Work out where the elbow needs to be work out where the shoulder needs to be

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.360
 And that is I don't know because we don't know what mathematics our brains are running

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.160
 But I believe that's kind of sort of how our brains interpret it as well

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.240
 Like I don't ever think about my shoulder or my elbow and I reach out and grab my giant mug of coffee

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.660
 I just grab my giant mug of coffee because that's where I want my hand to be

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.760
 So I believe that's that question

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.920
 Moving forwards to Rico's question Rico says will there be more features to make easier to create things for desktop users?

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.460
 Depends what you mean there if you could elaborate on what difficulties were having as a desktop user

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.480
 I might be able to answer you more effectively Aaron asks. Is there a question you're surprised?

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.480
 Nobody has been asking an office hours yet

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.260
 I'm always curious about sort of like some of the weirder parts of news that no one seems to use

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.120
 I would love to answer questions about the areas which I use

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:42.020
 every day that no one else uses like let's get some more questions about the

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.380
 3d volumes

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.500
 Slices the measure tip the meter tip the distance meter component

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.760
 You know more questions like that like if I haven't heard of the component and you ask about it

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.220
 You should get like a badge you get like oh my god prime hasn't heard of this component badge

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.500
 Alex you can watch the recording. I

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:09.100
 Can't continually repeat myself. It's it's like we run on into the future

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.640
 Ozzy says there was a new tip added to initial tools recently. What's that intended? It was intended

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:19.680
 I did it and I don't really like I don't care what anyone thinks what I did was I took the mesh visibility

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:26.840
 Tooltip and I made it visible inside essential tools. It was completely invisible. I also updated the

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:30.440
 this visual for the

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:37.140
 component clone tip so that you can actually see it's the yellow one because again like the picture like I basically just

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.880
 updated the pictures because it was bothering me the

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:47.520
 Three people in that week had asked about the mesh visibility tip and I'm like, it's there

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.600
 It's just the invisible one and I'm like hang on a minute. Why can't I just update this and I'm like I can so I did

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.000
 I understand that that breaks muscle memory. There's nothing I can do about that

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.200
 I think it's better in the long run that the mesh visibility tip is now actually visible

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.720
 I just found it ridiculous

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.020
 like and then someone needed the component clone tip and they didn't realize that that was the component clone tip because again it was you

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.360
 Know the picture was very small. What I'd love us to do is get

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.380
 You know probably get some like good UI

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.760
 not designers illustrators would be the appropriate term for this particular task to make

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.440
 Diagrams and pictures for each tool that we would then replace in the inventory

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.720
 Rather than a picture of the tool tip

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.560
 It would be like a square with the word developer tip and then a picture of the developer tip

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.120
 you know like a billboard ad sort of I just think that'd be a lot clearer and better than

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:44.960
 An often weirdly stretched blurry photo that you can only really tell which tip it is by the color. So

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.640
 To summarize I guess it is not a new tip. I just updated it so you can see it

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.640
 If anyone has a problem with that

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.920
 I will turn invisible and you won't be able to find me

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:03.160
 Just like the mesh visibility tip which is designed to make stuff invisible, but itself was invisible very confusing

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:10.360
 Alex's where is the recording the recording will be up between one and seven days from the time of this

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.880
 Session it really does depend on what I need to do immediately following this if I get distracted

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.960
 It's suddenly midnight and I haven't done it which then means it's Wednesday and I haven't done it

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.960
 And then if I have way too much like 3d graphic stuff to do on Wednesday

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:29.840
 I just can't I can't run the eye. Rusio says has prime heard of the linear map of 3d or

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.280
 We're just gonna like test me out. Like do I know these components?

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.080
 The reason why I'm delaying is because I'm actually going to my youtube channel because I think I have a video on the linear mappers

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.520
 Yeah, I do 31st October 2019, yeah, I know about the linear mappers

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:52.720
 Moving forwards to stifle says I wonder if prime has heard of the lapping multi clip player before. Yes

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.960
 I have someone was asking about that misunderstanding what was going on. There's one of those that is broken

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.560
 One of the clip players is broken. I can't remember which one is broken. I need to look at both of their names

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.840
 I'm in Neo, so I'll just empty object attach component media and see if I can find it

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:15.260
 It's in players. It's an audio then. Yeah, there's the lapping multi clip player and the multi audio clip player

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.480
 And one of those is broken. There was an issue I was reading about moving forwards

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:25.460
 Rusio said that they assumed it would be invisible like an in joke. I don't agree of in jokes the hamper

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:30.380
 Uses freedom like an in joke is totally fine. For example

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.520
 Really don't know of a good example

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.360
 I guess the example is when you like, you know

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:41.500
 I mean in the bottom left of discord when you click like the area that's got your your doobly-doo your numbers on it

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:46.460
 You can copy actually that's changed recently because now it just brings up that used to be that when you click that it would copy

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.900
 It to clipboard and if you clicked it like a few times like there'd be a little white to die like the elephant

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:58.240
 Logo person would not the logo one but the one that they animate sometimes would come up and go to die or something

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.240
 That's that's a fun joke

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.240
 Something that like is a detriment to uses is not a fun joke though. Oh, yeah, Sasha

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:12.140
 I do want to ask why is the clear logics interface but icon in there called clear logics which ends born actually called clear

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:17.360
 Interfaces no actual confused problem. Just confused me and how that desync. I don't know how that desync either

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.860
 I'd have to look into it. Maybe they did the picture thing

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.180
 You can customize inventory thumbnails and maybe they customize the inventory thumbnail for it

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:33.000
 But just didn't update the thumbnail being forwards Tiki says there's the new neat say the MMC 23 map

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.280
 When I play it, I find myself missing blocks if I never actually see the saber inside the block

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.760
 Especially when the framerate is low. Do you think it'd be possible to make more efficient block hit detection using logics?

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.280
 Just to know if colliders the most efficient solution to the already

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.120
 Colliders should be the most efficient solution. I've had people before

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:56.920
 That have said something on the lines of like but my logic's collision code is better and I've come like do you have any idea?

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.800
 What you're saying?

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.280
 Inside the physics engine that we use to do collisions is

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.720
 Awesome. Awesome code that you just can't do like overlaps

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:14.960
 Intersections all that sort of like terminology for the physics and that's how it works out whether to colliders are colliding and that's how it works

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:22.760
 Out if mesh colliders are colliding it's like it's insane. It's examining each individual triangle and seeing if it overlaps of another triangle

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.440
 It's crazy. You can't do some of that in logic, but not all of it

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.200
 I've had someone literally say that they were going to take their object and sort of surround it in

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.880
 Ray cast a little bit like pinhead from Hellraiser to try and see if it's colliding in anything and I'm like

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.160
 Could you not just put an active collider on it?

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.520
 And I heard active colliders were bad and I said yeah, but what you're suggesting is much worse

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.120
 Active colliders are not bad by the way

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.380
 You just need to use them carefully spec says on that note if you're working with a team

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.640
 Please don't name your slots after memes instead of meaningful descriptions working with a team is an interesting

00:22:53.640 --> 00:23:00.060
 Exploration and I'm happy to see that there are you know some standard teams that always come out MSC and do a really good job

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:05.340
 but I'm also happy to see as well that there are a lot of people who maybe haven't worked in a team before and are

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.760
 learning the

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.680
 quirks of doing that there is a lot of stuff that goes into there for anyone who doesn't know by

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.920
 By trade is wrong because I don't actually do it right now, but I spent

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.840
 Five six years as an engineer, and I've spent five or six years as a product manager

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.440
 I didn't understand what a product manager did but now I do

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.240
 People often get that role confused as well because a couple word manager and

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:35.400
 Manager has sort of connotations of being sort of like a leader or in charge or a boss in quotes

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.600
 When it comes to product manager, it's anything but our job is basically to orchestrate chaos

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.680
 And and that's what we do if you're a people manager. That's the traditional management thing that guys are

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:54.300
 Afraid of or apprehensive about if you're a product manager your job is to manage the product don't manage people so it's different

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.640
 Lex looked up. Yep. It's a custom thumbnail

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:03.560
 Item texture thumbnail source, I don't think has been renamed I can check for you. I go here

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.420
 I can go to item texture thumbnail source

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.360
 Looks like it used to be called texture thumbnail source. I don't know if that was before or after I made a video on it

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.820
 So I will check my channel make sure that's up to date item

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.880
 customize

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.100
 inventory

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.360
 Customize inventory thumbnails, let's see what I call it

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.480
 Oh

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.960
 Dear this is a three minute video run this at five times speed. I am running it faster than YouTube can keep up

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.440
 Give me a second here YouTube buffer the video

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.460
 Okay, I'll leave that buffering for a bit. I'll see if my tutorials up to that

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:41.680
 There are some frame synchronization issues for physics, which I think we're planning on looking at later. Thanks. Hey, look

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.920
 so the update was

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.960
 September 20th, and I did this

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.080
 Wish here September 20th 2021. Yeah, my videos are date. That's fine

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.400
 When we when we get going again with updates, I'll

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.380
 Start having some sort of policy on how I update videos and stuff

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.920
 I have a lot of people that comment on my world creation video and they're like this is all day

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.480
 I understand that the - is different but like if you just ignored the - everything's still valid

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:15.680
 Think says now that's where you trust on users to understand the names of the UI same but different UI homeless

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.400
 Wanna step by step holding the hand the exact same, you know, yeah, you are right and I've always said this

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.200
 I'm just you know reset it we are at time, but I'll restate it

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:30.200
 Anyone is free to make Neos tutorial videos and at some point I do hope that the Neos team themselves

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.920
 make

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:38.520
 Their own tutorials at which point they will be much better orchestrated planned and scripted

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.140
 You know, I'll probably be involved in those etc

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:48.120
 The the reason why my channel exists is to do tutorials in my style and my brand which is just like I hit go and I

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.280
 Record none of my videos are planned actually a couple of them are planned

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.820
 But like they still aren't planned when I hit there's no script

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.420
 The one where I did mineable or for example, that one was planned

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.440
 I had to go get some assets for that one, etc

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:05.800
 But I hit go and I just started talking I didn't have any script in mind. It's working out great

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.640
 Hence why everyone likes them, but there is a point in

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.600
 Neos's future I hope where my tutorials are sin as

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.560
 Less good because they are not scripted and that's absolutely fine

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.880
 And I like that day whenever that day happens

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.800
 I can we take a look at just a popular tutorial channel for a very popular topic, you know

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:33.640
 Maybe web development or something those people they plan and script so so so much

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:42.580
 To get the best quality video and then I'm just there like record giggle. Stop recording start recording again giggle

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.640
 Yeah, I don't like editing if I have to edit it would take me longer to learn to edit than it would to

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:53.260
 Just rerecord it. Well, there's been a couple of times where I've accidentally leaked like personal information or something

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.420
 You know what happens with OBS and I've gone I'll have to edit that out and blur it

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.840
 I've gone or I could just rerecord it and that'll take me ten minutes

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.020
 But I just rerecord it take a look at the outtakes video if you'd like to see some of those outtakes

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.560
 there are hundreds of exactly the same thing there Jackal says that the tutorials appealed to them because

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.000
 They're not polished. Yeah, I know it's exactly why I keep doing them

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.320
 I do need to I've got this idea for a meme video where I do a mock

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:23.440
 Video in the star everyone else does tutorials. We're gonna have dubstep. We're gonna have intros

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.960
 We have like a subscriber met thing would have the bell up here

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.640
 We're gonna have a raid shadow legend sponsor and it's gonna be a very simple tutorial

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.000
 It's gonna be like how to click a button in Neos like

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.400
 20 minutes with just like a single like second of left click. I should also you're right

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.680
 I should also do a hyper cam video. That would be great. I couldn't actually do raid shadow legends

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.760
 I I put ready to add a legend through the thesaurus and I came up with a very close title

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:56.260
 Which I'll make up and trust me that the sponsorship segment will have like a dragon downloaded from sketch fair

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.120
 But like reading and stuff, it'll be awesome. Okay, we have one final question

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.480
 I was just about to end but Zach did ask a question says how do I set up a dove dev tooltip again?

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.820
 You attach the dev to totally

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.680
 You attach the dev

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:17.440
 Tooltip component and everything will just work I can get you the name of that that component. Give me a second

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.840
 No, that's the logic step dev tooltip. There you go. Yeah, the actual whole part of the video will take

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:31.000
 300 times longer than the actual tutorial content of the video, which is just how to click a button

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.040
 So but that's the kind of the point

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.800
 Anyway with that we are at time we've been at time for like 10 minutes

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.840
 I will go ahead and leave us off here if you have any additional questions in the tight in the meantime

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.280
 Drop them questions and help channel DM me. Send me a carrier pigeon

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:53.080
 Whatever you want to do. I will get back to you with another office hours in a week. I will speak to them

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:53.580
 Bye bye.
