00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Welcome to office hours with prime if you go ahead and get your questions in the office hours thread for questions

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.320
 We'll get them answered in the order that they appear there are currently no questions

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.080
 So we're gonna sit here in unimaginable silence until there are questions

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.420
 For those who you who are just joining and don't know what this is. This is in half hour sometimes 45 minutes

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.600
 Sometimes an hour depends how distracted I get

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.920
 segment where you can ask questions about Neos and I will answer them whilst inevitably rambling about other things not to do of Neos such as

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.640
 Prime's magical journey through this world that we live in so feel free to get your questions in until then

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.320
 No noise will occur from my mouth runtime asks, can you turn the elevator music back on?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.440
 I didn't know that that was my responsibility. I think you can turn it back on

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.040
 The waiting room at least you can't turn it back on whilst the the stage has been started as far as more weather

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.120
 There we go our first Neos question fantastic

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.320
 We have a question here from Lou Xanth who says is is there a way to change where a dev tip spawns an inspector?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.300
 I do not think so, but in the effort of completeness, I'm gonna go ahead and open up the code base

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.720
 Which I haven't done today

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.120
 And I will load into that piece of the code as soon as I can and give you another answer

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 As far as I remember what it does is it will raycast in front of you to find unoccupied space and put it in there

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.040
 for the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.960
 Logics tip there's actually a better alternative there

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.160
 Which I've seen a lot of people to Ray V was I think the first person I saw who did it

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.980
 But now a lot of more people do it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.480
 Where they attach a logics panel to their wrist and then they can pull nodes out of that

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.440
 It means they never close or open the logics panel. It's just always there

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.400
 Which which seems to work out better for them. It sort of reminds me of the flap

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.560
 That's on Buzz Lightyear's arm. I know that's just a sticker under there

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 But like, you know, it could be it could be the logic sim on you. That's like a weird thing

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.840
 It's like Ray V's arm reminds me of Buzz Lightyear's arm. There you go, and that can go in quotes

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.560
 Alright code is loaded. I don't know if it's gonna respond to control T requests, but we'll see control T is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 Like the way to like just search through everything in a code base in C sharp

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.640
 so if I do like control T I type dev tool tip in I get to the source code for the dev tool tip, but

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 If the code base isn't fully finished initializing into official studio

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.560
 Sometimes that just won't work. So I have to like wait and be like hmm

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.000
 Control T. Are you going to work today or you're not going to work today and it is it is working today

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.480
 interesting

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.520
 Code here. I haven't read ever. Oh

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.400
 Here we are open inspector. Oh

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.100
 Cool open inspector cool

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.220
 To do create inspector. Okay and create inspector will do oh, yeah

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.080
 Okay, so it just creates an inspector and then it will

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.360
 Position the inspector in front of you using a very common function that of course you don't know which can't be the source code

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.520
 called

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.480
 position in front of user where position in front of user will

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.240
 Interesting

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.360
 Interesting. Oh, no that only runs in user space. Okay, cool. All right

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.480
 Yeah, okay, so it just gets a point in front of the user get point in front of these

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.080
 It is exactly what I said it just raycast in front

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.760
 Looks at that distance and then positions it so no you can't control it

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.000
 The interesting thing was some special case handling for user space that doesn't really make sense and doesn't isn't needed

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.040
 So I mean is needed of course, but like it's not part of the question

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.120
 It just I read it confusingly because it made it sense

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.080
 Like it made sense to like that wasn't running in user space. It would have been interesting, but it's running

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.720
 Same with the logic node it will just do exactly the same thing unfortunately with the logic tip buzz light your wristwatch

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.720
 Yeah buzz light your wristwatch

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.880
 Moving onwards to specs this question

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.160
 Do you have any documentation on building your ex it could be overwhelming to try and build interfaces with since the required?

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.120
 Components are not immediately intuitive nor is the fact that the hierarchy matters a lot more than things

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.360
 There is a 13 part YouTube tutorial series on a certain person's YouTube channel about uax development

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.480
 Might have heard of him that is to need like large-scale documentation. I know of that system though. It's also 13 parts

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.960
 I've actually heard of people saying I don't want to learn new x because prime tutorial series on is 13 parts

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:23.000
 Or I can't be bothered to watch 13 parts, and it's just like I don't know what you want from me like I make video tutorials

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.440
 Yeah, yeah, thank you for some enthusiasm on it. There is a lot of stuff there

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:38.080
 I don't know if all of its helpful or for it'll make sense because there is like an awful lot

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.080
 I try and go through

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.480
 In sort of a logical fashion

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.280
 Where we don't we don't cover layouts until it looks like part 10

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.680
 What I would encourage people to do is just use layouts all the time in the first couple of videos you'll see

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.900
 Me manipulating rec transforms directly and lots of people still do that manually right they'll manually update rec transforms

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:07.360
 But what I recommend instead is just wherever possible use horizontal vertical or critical instead of manually changing rate transforms and

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.540
 If you're worried about like no the performance the slot count inspector inspector

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.400
 It's basically just like horizontal horizontal vertical horizontal vertical horizontal horizontal vertical vertical horizontal vertical

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.900
 It just keeps going. It's like it's insanely deep if you look at the

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.500
 Inspector spec says that they did come across it, but it wasn't complete apparently

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.580
 Part 13 was made a year ago. I

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.160
 Don't think it's ever gonna be complete. That's one of the things in my tutorials. I never say that they're complete

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.540
 Yeah, I recommend you touch it biggest point of advice is

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.600
 Please use the layout components. They are there to help you

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:54.900
 Manually adjusting right transforms is just not ideal and yeah most UI systems that you'll see in game engines have similar systems where it looks

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.800
 Like you're making a mess, but it's just how you do it

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:04.160
 You know if you think you know you acts is bad or even as DIA says if you think you iron kiddo or unity or unreal

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.320
 Is bad just go ahead and hit view source on google.com and just question everything about the universe and what you knew

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.180
 Like I because I you know, I'm very familiar with with web design and web development

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:22.080
 I can I can tell you what all of google.com does but it will still take me like five minutes to figure it out

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.680
 No, I want to go to google.com. I don't want to search for Google for google.com

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.680
 How the hell did that happen?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.720
 anyway

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:36.960
 moving forwards I had this interesting conversation very recently some other people in other context but a

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.080
 Lot of cases I find tools that people make slower than the actual like real way of doing it

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.840
 So I have seen a couple of like things which claim to be

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.160
 UIX creators or UX tool things that make it easier to do UIX, but I always just go back to

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.880
 UX like actual I will now scroll up and down and make sure I haven't missed any other questions Oh

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.280
 Shadow has a different a different problem with the logic step

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.880
 I'll go ahead and look at the code of logic step

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.520
 What they want to do is to figure out the the logics for where the node will spawn from the logic step

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.400
 So when you when you spawn a node where that's positioned that one I might be able to help you

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.320
 I move I've just got to see where that goes

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.480
 Tip. Yeah, it goes to the tip. So the the the

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:31.280
 Tip of the tip the tip of the tooltip is is where that goes so you can go ahead and edit the tip position

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.400
 That will answer that one

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.160
 You just double check not missing any questions before the YouTube video link got it right now

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.500
 I wrote to Specs question

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.320
 So Specs says how was this year's MMC voting any new bugs or issues with the voting world or mostly smooth sailing?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.460
 Something interesting happened this year, which didn't happen last year, which I was a little grumpy about

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.880
 So I apologize if any of you received the grumpiness of that

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.240
 Do you remember that I have to run that thing three days straight and make sure that nothing goes wrong ever?

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.200
 Because you know, we try and get like people voting as much as possible

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.520
 Some people had issues and some people direct messaged me about those issues

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:10.840
 Great more on that in a moment. Some people posted those issues publicly in a public channel. Not good DM me, please

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.160
 It's just better to DM people about problems particularly when they like can be fixed really easily

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.440
 It's slightly more polite as well. So we had a couple of those those were fixed up

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.380
 And then the one that did DM me about it. They found quite a

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.960
 potentially problematic issue

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.080
 but they explored it in a way which was not okay, which is

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.840
 so they found a way to

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.300
 Duplicate and delete the voting panels because I forgot to put delete block and duplicate block on those panels

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.220
 I understand finding that and being like that's a problem that needs to be fixed

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.340
 But when I went in the world like five or six of the booths had been deleted or duplicated so were broken

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.480
 It's like if you found a problem, maybe do it again another time

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.520
 So twice to replicate that is a problem, but then stop don't break any more of the world stop and report the issue

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.440
 Because like I think five five panels were down by the time I got there

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.440
 So I just took it down for five minutes to fix that one

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.960
 That sort of comes into sort of responsible disclosure and things like that. It's like hey

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.240
 If I push this button on this bank's website, it gives me a million dollars. So I'm gonna push it a hundred times

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:21.620
 And then tell the bank it's like you push it once until the bank one of the most interesting problems of MMC voting though

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.620
 Is I forgot how it worked. I

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.360
 Have a huge notebook

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:33.180
 I use obsidian for my notebook and I usually write extensive notes on everything that I do but my notes for MMC's voting

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.640
 Were lackluster somehow for some reason. I don't know if I was just like busy or whatever and didn't make them

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.120
 So I just I didn't know anything

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.080
 For example when I went through the world testing it I noticed that when you vote in ESD or art

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.320
 it'll say saved instead of vote cast for blah and category blah and

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:57.920
 I was like, why is this happening again? This doesn't make sense. Why is it different sort of like debugging madly unpacked a few logics knows

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.600
 I'm just like, oh, yeah, that's why we don't have locale strings in the NES locale files for those two categories

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.140
 So I can't fully localized do the phrase vote cast in category blah for category blah

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.440
 In those two category instances

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.040
 So I had to just switch to something I did have a locale string for which is saved

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.480
 Saved is one of the locale strings, which is just part of Neos core

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.540
 And so I could just stole that one

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.120
 in fact

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:30.080
 The majority like, you know, two-thirds or more of the strings that exist inside the voting panel are localized using

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:37.780
 Neos locale strings and then the remainders are used, you know actual MMC specific strings things like okay

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:45.220
 Cancel. Yes, you know, those are all available to be localized by everyone. So if you're ever looking to make a world

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.800
 for multiple audiences

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.520
 You can use those locale strings

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.960
 It's a little bit tricky having a tutorial on it and I don't really have time to explain it here

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.840
 So I'm asked I probably will try but you know, but you've got that, you know, if you're just using like, okay

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.440
 Yes, no save cancel. You've got no excuse not translated to every single language which Neos supports

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.960
 I mean for a nationwide question who says

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.320
 Why do some logics nodes is a eg is user present in world seemingly just not work without an updating relay after them?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.200
 Shouldn't those knows update themselves since they're all for an updating relation used

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.600
 It's difficult for me to understand

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.000
 I've asked Fuchs a couple of times, but he seems to answer for that specific case. What I want is

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.120
 Like a rule of thumb, but what I get is an individual reason

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.440
 So it's a little bit challenging in that regard

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.640
 I just opened the is user present node and

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:46.200
 Oh, no, wait, I did the is user on ground node somehow by a mistake. I

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.520
 Don't know how that happened because I typed present and I got like oh

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.320
 There we go. Yeah. Um, so it just it's just a quirk that I don't understand

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.880
 the rule of thumb that I have now established though is

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.660
 Put updating relays in if you notice a problem

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.420
 But just before you're done making your application before you're done making your world or whatever

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:07.840
 It is

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.200
 remove those updating relays and see if it still works and the reason I say that is because a lot of times we add updating relays

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.480
 Because we want to see the values for a good example of that being is the global transform

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.240
 Node we usually want to pull out a display node and look at the global transform of an object as it moves around

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.400
 Etc and because we're human we want to see those numbers move

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.360
 Maybe that helps us to figure out what we need to do to those numbers to do the effect that we want

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.620
 but what we actually then do once we figure those out is we have an impulse chain and

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.560
 Little

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.560
 like most understood

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.920
 misunderstood think about about logics is when an impulse is

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:52.680
 Evaluating nodes along its chain. It will have the most up-to-date value whilst that impulse is being processed

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.160
 But the display node might not update still so example

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:03.980
 There might be you take the global transform of a cube and then you write that global transform plus 10 in the Y

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:10.300
 So you're just moving up by 10 units, but the global transform display node might not update but the

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.880
 Logic knows that it's correct, right?

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:21.600
 Because when the impulse fires it can pick up that value because it picks up the most relevant most recent evaluated value from there

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:28.880
 What happens there is that the impulse chain executing will instruct that node to get the latest value

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.920
 But that display node doesn't instruct it to get the latest value because it's a different way of looking at it

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.140
 Which is then sometimes why the updating relay is needed so you can see their numbers moving

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.920
 But if it's only impulses that are using this data

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.440
 Then you don't need the updating relay

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.440
 Hence if it makes it easier for you to develop logics put the updating relays in there

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:54.000
 Try removing them once the logic is complete and then you can be like happy and be like I removed one and I didn't actually

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.600
 Need it and then you'll start learning when they are on when they are not needed

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:04.320
 As for why some nodes have it and why some nodes don't I don't really know sometimes this is sort of optimization thing

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:11.440
 There are some nodes as well, which are like clearly meant more to be used locally rather than synchronized across the network

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:17.560
 Most of those exist in sort of the weird areas of controllers and things like those

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:23.400
 Like, you know controller nodes always local. I really liked it meant to sync every single controller boolean across the network

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.560
 It just meant to sort of sync the result like ah, they push the trigger that means the gunfire

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.560
 So we transmit over the network gunfire not trigger pulled. Let's move over to

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.820
 additional question

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.720
 Shadow asks, is there a good tutorial and a proper use tensor materials and this dead

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.160
 This does some parameters on limit

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.340
 I've got it to half work one time really like a clear guide on it watching unity tutorials

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:53.080
 It's also not ideal as those include editing shader code, which is different from Neos. No, there is no guide on it

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.060
 I usually just scratch my head and scream when I do it, but

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.980
 There was one

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:04.620
 I'll try and find it. There was one like blog article that was unity related

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:10.220
 but it had sufficient information for me to understand it and apply it to

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.780
 Neos it did talk. Yeah, this is the one it did talk about

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.740
 Editing shader code etc. But I I just mapped those shader code editing

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:28.700
 Ujima flips to the material inspector. There is a bug as well, I believe with

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.200
 Some of the stuff going on there

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:38.900
 In the some of the the shaders that have stencil parameters don't have Z right and you kind of need to in some cases

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:44.200
 manipulate the Z right operation as well as these stencil parameters to get everything to work and

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:51.720
 I you know couldn't figure that out either looks like this one's good particularly because it references are one of my favorite games which is

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:57.040
 Anti-chamber. I need to do another run of anti-chamber, but like there's a good there's a good link there for it as well

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.040
 All right moving that down to the thread

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.000
 So we've got the shader the stencil question done. We'll scroll up and down make sure I haven't missed any others

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.080
 No other questions have been missed. So if you have any additional questions, please go ahead and

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.080
 Give it a look

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.440
 Meant to be like an anti chamber - she did this this Daniel website is a little bit broken

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:22.060
 Because I just clicked a link and it said like localhost 4000 because they haven't updated the logo in the top left there

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.060
 they have a bunch of

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:32.120
 Universal rendering pipeline tutorial they have a bunch of tutorials. They're a bit old from 2021, but like I will bookmark this website

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.520
 OZ I believe I answered that question less than less than a month ago like so

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.480
 Well

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:46.540
 Maybe refer to the older notes on that one. No main changes that although I'm thinking of headsets

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:54.340
 The big screen headset the one that's really light awesome looking headset, but don't make me require an Apple phone to purchase it

00:16:54.340 --> 00:17:01.040
 Thanks. There we go. It has to be a 2018 or newer Apple phone and not the SE series. Yeah, that's that's really weird

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.560
 I get it because they want the 3d scan data

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.920
 If they like partnered with a store, I actually don't know the names of tech stores in the US

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:16.720
 I was about to say Curry's but no one would knowing that any idea what I'm talking about, but Curry's PC world

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.040
 Big Best Buy, maybe

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.680
 name a tech store, maybe if they partner with a tech store like go to the tech store and

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.800
 Have your face scan by a thing there and buy it there. That would be good

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.400
 I think they could do that but like it's almost like they're too late for that

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.880
 Stores are dying and I've even to a mall recently, but it's crazy

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:43.500
 I bet you the Apple store employees will love that if it gets popular. Are you here to buy an iPhone, sir?

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:50.000
 No, I'm here to scare my face and then leave and never come back would be my response. I did just buy a brand new phone

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.280
 I'm now running a

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.280
 pixel 7 pro and

00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:00.200
 Come on, but the next time I buy a phone it's gonna be you know, like 2030 or something

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.240
 The last time I bought a phone I looked it up was something like 2013. I don't know

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.480
 I'll have to after double-check that exact number. I don't really know

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.840
 Tiki us is there a way to have more than one camera for recording thought about having a second news client if anything if you mean

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.160
 Simultaneously no, there is no way currently to have a second camera to record

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.220
 Things that you can do though, and this is really hacky, but I've done it multiple times

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.920
 so I will mention it is if you put your camera your main camera into orthographic mode and

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:36.520
 Stick it into a camera anchor you can then position additional cameras in front of that orthographic camera

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.740
 And you can kind of set up like a CCTV view, you know

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.060
 Where you've got like a grid of four cameras on the screen

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:48.320
 And that way you can record multiple camera angles. There is a bit gross though because it's like, you know

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.520
 Taking a photo of your phone to like share

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:58.820
 It's that one sometimes with like logs or Neos we asked for log files when you know diagnosing issues

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:04.660
 there are sometimes where I've got like a phone camera picture of the log file on someone's screen and I'm just like

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:13.440
 But yeah, it's a bit like doing that but it that has worked a few times we did that for data collection as well

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.600
 Sometimes we had like three camera angles and then the third

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.260
 Fourth the fourth the final quadrant was data like a graph or something

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:28.700
 And that was like, you know, three camera angles plus a graph to show what's going on. That was good orthographic camera

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:33.780
 Though is is pretty needed there. Otherwise you get the perspective

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:42.040
 Doubly added because you're looking at a perspective camera looking at perspective cameras like an orthographic looking at perspective camera. That's fine

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.040
 But if you're doing two perspectives, sometimes it just looks weird. Okay, I've solved Tiki's problem

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.480
 Yeah, we've got exactly what they need there. Yeah, try it out. If you have any issues, let me know

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.800
 I do I do it all the time. Also remember the sender display tip

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.240
 You might not be able to make the streaming camera orthographic

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.680
 So in which case make an orthographic regular camera use the center display tip on it

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.200
 And then it'll do the equivalent thing

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.940
 The center display tip was the old version of the mirror to display option that exists inside the camera streaming thing

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:13.200
 I think that's what we do. Keep the questions coming. We're um running up against the clock here

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.820
 But I'm happy to go if anyone else has any additional questions

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:20.900
 See Jackal is typing so we'll take Jackal's question and then we will leave off

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:29.640
 If you have other questions that would help you understand stuff go for it like, you know, we're here for all levels of

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:36.580
 Understanding. Okay. We'll wait for runtime and shadow now just shadow guys. If you've got questions, you have to type faster. Come on

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:41.680
 I want to hear your like desk make like aggressive banging noises from your typing

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.840
 Just so you can get the question out before we close. No, no worries red tape

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.860
 It's always weird when you call out people for that typing indicator. I wish you could turn it off

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.260
 you can turn it off on I think telegram and

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:59.540
 Maybe what's that? Yeah, I usually if I have the option to I turn it off so people don't see that I am typing

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.360
 I think it's just like in some situations

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.760
 It can cause anxiety

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:10.580
 Like here's an example you're at work and you use Microsoft Teams and it's like your manager is typing and you notice it

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.580
 It's just like oh

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:20.560
 Yeah, okay, so we have no further questions some comments on typing noises so go ahead and leave off here

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.880
 I'm gonna go consume like half a cow worth of food and I'll get back to you later

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.400
 If you have any questions, please drop them in the questions help channel direct message me. Send me carrier pigeons. Send me smoke signals

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.480
 I'll try and respond do

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.000
 Remember that we can all

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.520
 Enjoy eating cows

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.080
 Not tipsy cow tipsy cow is a restaurant that is about one town over

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.960
 It takes me like a 20 to 30 minute bus ride to get there. Otherwise, I'll be going there all the time

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.780
 No, I'm just gonna go find whatever's in the cupboard and shove it in my face

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.520
 I don't know what it is. I mean look I will speech you later. Bye. Bye
