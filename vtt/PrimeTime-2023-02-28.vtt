WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 All right, and we start the recording because we're late.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.640
 Sorry for being late, everyone.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.880
 Welcome to Office Hours.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.740
 I was cognizant of the time up until 10 to,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.620
 and then I don't know what happened, and it was 16:01.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.080
 So I just didn't get everything done.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.100
 But we're live now.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.240
 I created the thread.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.440
 Welcome to Office Hours.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.280
 If you have any questions, please drop them

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.880
 in the Office Hours text chat thread, which I just made.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.040
 Once again, apologies for the confusion.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.120
 I see people flooding in.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.880
 That's fantastic.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.160
 We'll give them a few minutes to flood in,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.600
 and we'll keep going a few minutes

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.480
 after due to my tardiness.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.600
 Remember at school, some teachers would use,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.280
 like, you're late, and other teachers

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.560
 would use, like, you're tardy.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.640
 And I always felt like tardy or tardiness was more

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.960
 insultive than saying that I was late,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840
 and I don't really know why.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.680
 It was like, somehow, more insultive.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.140
 So I have a question from Lex, who

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.720
 says, how's the run up to the MMC deadline

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.920
 as an organizer been?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.640
 It's usually quite OK for me, as Medra usually handles

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.760
 most of the complexities there.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.360
 We do get a lot of questions which just repeat every year,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.880
 and they kind of amaze me, really,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.920
 because we haven't changed anything in quite a long time

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 now.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.400
 Sometimes we change the categories or the prize amounts,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.840
 but the general core principles of the rules haven't changed,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.080
 yet people still seem to be very surprised by them.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.160
 We often get questions about licenses and things like that.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.800
 I guess this is an opportunity to sort of clear some of that

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.880
 up a little bit.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.320
 We don't decide what can and cannot be used in the MMC.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 What we decide is only appropriate licensed assets

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.400
 can be used in the MMC.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.960
 So when you come to us with an asset,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.880
 and you're like, can we use this?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.000
 We don't make the determination.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.040
 We read the license which makes that determination.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.240
 You basically have to learn how to read licenses, which

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.160
 you should be doing all of the time,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.680
 but you really only do for the MMC

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 if you're not really exposed to them every day.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.080
 But if you take a look at a license,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.840
 it very clearly will state if you can use it inside the MMC.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.120
 It doesn't use the words, can be used inside the MMC.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.560
 What it uses is words such as, you

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.040
 can redistribute these assets.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.120
 You can use these assets commercially.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120
 You can use these assets if you credit me, things like that.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.800
 Those are the words that you need to be looking for.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.160
 If you read a license and it says, can't be used by Prime,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.480
 then it's quite clearly that not only can I not

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.560
 use that asset in the MMC, I can't use that asset anywhere.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.960
 And so that's the distinction.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.720
 We get a lot of people who think that we are the deciders.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.280
 We're not.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.360
 We just read the license, which then informs us

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.760
 of what the decision is.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.160
 The decision existed before we took a look.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.640
 So if you can read licenses, you don't need to ask us.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.480
 It's kind of crazy that that keeps coming up.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.880
 The license says you can use it, provided

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.880
 you can credit people.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.400
 And then people still say, but can we use it in the MMC?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.440
 And it's like, well, what does the license say?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.320
 And people go, don't know, because they don't read them.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.400
 Or sometimes they're very long and complicated.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.840
 And we all understand that.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.440
 And so we'll always answer for you.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.080
 But I want to, again, make that distinction clear.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.840
 We don't make the decision.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.440
 The license makes the decision.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.720
 And that's why it's so important to not use any assets

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.560
 that you don't have licenses to, or if it's unclear,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.000
 and the safest option being, don't use it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.720
 I guess we'll keep going.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.220
 If there's any other questions, though,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.640
 I'd love to go through them.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.140
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.280
 This is another one from MMC.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.680
 Is there anything new you've learned from the MMC

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.420
 submissions so far, assuming you've seen some?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.260
 I actually haven't had a chance to see some.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.280
 I've been a bit busy over the past couple of days,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.600
 mostly with headaches and weird medical-related issues.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.840
 I had a blood draw yesterday.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.260
 It had to be a fasting one, which is why you can't eat.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.180
 And it wiped me out for the entire day.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.240
 And I don't know why.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.320
 It was only three vials.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.580
 I have no idea why.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.280
 I've had six, seven, eight vials sometimes taken.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.340
 But these three vials, and I had to not eat before them.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.120
 And I immediately found food afterwards.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.920
 I got straight back on the bus home, got into the kitchen,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.680
 and devoured anything I could find.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.060
 But still, I was tired.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.820
 And the only thing I can think of is a whole combination

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.500
 of events--

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.260
 don't eat, take blood, travel, whatever, wipe me out.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.360
 And then I had a headache for the entire night as well.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.120
 And the blood work came back.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.760
 And I'm not allowed to take any painkillers for a month

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.260
 to test some results of that blood work.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.360
 And so I'm like, cool, guess I'll die.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.740
 So I just rolled around in bed.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.760
 Hey, there's these amazing--

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.620
 I'm going to get everyone the link to them.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.860
 If you get bad headaches sometimes,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.020
 you need to get these.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.820
 Let's see if I can find them.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.440
 There's a particular brand I use.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.280
 Yeah, here they are.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.320
 They've got a cool 1990s name.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.900
 Here they are.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.880
 I've dropped them in the thread.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.060
 I have four boxes of these, so I never run out.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.580
 And they're worth every penny.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.260
 That's a pack of nine for $30.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.180
 That's good.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.520
 I usually just buy one.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.180
 They're just cooling gel patches.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.800
 You can do the same really with ice.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.760
 But the problem I have with ice is I never

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.720
 remember to freeze it.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.700
 I've got a reasonable quality ice pack that's basically

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.320
 what looks like Orbeez in a plastic bag,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.880
 and even a Valkyrie thing.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.680
 I got that when I went to the dentist once.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.640
 I just never remember to put it in the freezer.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.300
 Whereas those are ready to go anytime,

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.660
 and they're quite portable.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.640
 I got a set in my travel bag as well.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.300
 So wherever I am in the world, I've got a set of those handy.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.240
 There's always gel and stuff like that.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.960
 Lots of times it looks like a sort

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.520
 of deodorant with a rollerball.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.280
 But I don't think they work as well as those gel sheets.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.600
 I don't particularly know why.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.020
 Gross thing about those gel sheets

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.760
 is you roll over in the middle of the night,

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.120
 and it falls off.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.680
 And then you wake up, and it's stuck to the side of your face

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.100
 because it's moved from your forehead, and you're just like,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.060
 ew.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.240
 But hey, it did its job.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.360
 Moving forwards, is this to-do going to be fulfilled?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.780
 So this is a to-do based on the Nenas voting server.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.600
 Yeah, so lots of people have said, yo,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.880
 I'm going to use mods and save the voting server

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.180
 so I can see how it works.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.680
 And I'm like, you know the voting server's open source,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.920
 and I'm happy that you're interested in it,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.760
 but maybe be interested in it not in the official voting

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.760
 world, maybe ask about it otherwise,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.900
 and I can just give you a look or give you a tour.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.360
 Don't mess with the actual vote.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.680
 So the to-do that Lex is pointing to

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.320
 is a to-do in a new system I added for 2022

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.680
 where I stored the entry name.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.600
 So when the result sheet is generated

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.920
 using some of the parts of that GitHub repo,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.760
 it used to be generated with just the record ID, which

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.200
 got really confusing when people did more than one entries,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.160
 and we kind of had to do it manually.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.400
 And we got tired of doing that, so I

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.400
 wrote a system that would look at doing it for storing

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.640
 the actual entry name.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.080
 But then lots of entries decided they wanted to use RTF tags,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.000
 so that each letter in their entry,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.400
 it was like a different color.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.440
 I'm reminded of the early days of MSN

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.280
 where you installed so many custom emojis that the sentence

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.960
 hello, how are you turned into like a Marvel film length

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.840
 sequence of animated emojis.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.920
 Those were the days of MSN.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.680
 So that's why that to-do is there.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.840
 I don't know if it will be resolved.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.560
 I kind of wait until the MMC is over

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.480
 before I get the voting going, because voting is like--

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.600
 it's not immediately afterwards.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.840
 It's not immediately afterwards, so there is some time.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.600
 That lets me set everything up.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.160
 It's also easier to set everything up

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.480
 once we have a list of entries.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.780
 So we can take a look at all the categories working

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.620
 and everything.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.440
 So I don't know.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.600
 It didn't affect us that much, because only one or two entries

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.760
 had the RTF tags.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.640
 And so we just was like, oh, it's the RTF tag entry

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.500
 by this person.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.800
 And then we knew what it was.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.100
 But if every entry had RTF tags, it

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.040
 would be a nightmare to go through the results sheet.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.240
 Ozzy asks, has the GitHub bot been down for a fair bit?

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.640
 It has been down for a fair bit.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.580
 It's low priority, because we're not really doing that much.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.840
 It's also weird, because every time we do something minor,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.800
 people go like, oh, oh, oh, oh, is this Big Update Marketplace?

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.320
 It's like, no, I merged a locale PR,

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.420
 because I felt bad about the people that

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.540
 have translated the entire game into a different language

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.880
 that we don't support yet.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.560
 And they haven't seen anything for two years,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.660
 and there's absolutely nothing wrong with their PR.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.200
 And if we leave it open, we'll just forget.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.400
 So I might as well merge it.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.460
 And that way, when we do resume updates,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.160
 we'll get that translation in.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.620
 And people are like, does this mean Big Update Marketplace?

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.700
 I'm like, it just means that I am just merging a PR.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.380
 It doesn't mean anything.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.920
 People are way too quick to put intention and behavior

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.500
 around small activities.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.760
 I feel like if people desired, I mean,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.800
 we'd probably see if we could get a restraining order

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.620
 or something.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.720
 But they'll be camping outside our houses

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.540
 and with telescopes into our window.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.260
 And they'll be like, [GASP] Prime touched his keyboard.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.020
 Does that mean Big Update Marketplace?

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.120
 It's like, nah, man.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.560
 That's just me ordering another cheese pizza.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.880
 Which reminds me, I want cheesy garlic bread.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.600
 And I want the biggest cheesy garlic bread

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.760
 that can be given to me.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.640
 My local grocery store is a Trader Joe's,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.160
 which is renowned for hipster-style food.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.240
 And their selection is always less than a larger grocery

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.600
 store because of that.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.200
 There is a larger grocery store a little bit further away

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.680
 from me, but I can never be bothered

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.080
 to walk that extra 10 minutes to get there.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.920
 But I went to that Trader Joe's yesterday,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.920
 and I was looking for the biggest garlic cheese mess.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.520
 I didn't care how big it was, how fattening it was.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.480
 I just wanted garlic and cheese and carbohydrates.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.320
 And I couldn't find any, so I was very sad.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.560
 For those who are like, you can order online, it's like,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.160
 have you seen the prices for online ordering of pizza-related

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.080
 goods these days?

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.120
 I'm like, I would like a single large garlic bread thing.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.880
 And they're like, please give us $30.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.040
 I'm like, what?

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.000
 That doesn't make any sense.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.560
 I was filling in some, I think it was tax forms the other day.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.160
 And I needed an address from when I lived in the UK.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.320
 So I knew the street name.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.520
 So I just typed the street name into my email.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.400
 And I found the full address by looking for a delivery food

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.160
 order from the UK.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.400
 And it was ridiculous.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.400
 It was something like two pizzas, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.120
 all this stuff.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.880
 And it was like less than $30.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.200
 And I'm like, how?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.840
 It was a lot of food, and it was very cheap.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.320
 And I'm just like, how?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.520
 Like, what planet was that?

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.120
 And then I looked at the year, and it was like,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.920
 I don't think like 2013 or something.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.440
 And I'm just like, ah, that's why.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.400
 Ozzy asks about if there are any headsets I'm looking forward

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.920
 to.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.520
 I am actually looking forward to that big screen headset.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.960
 The reason is just like, the more I think about it,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.920
 the more I realize it is the weight that is bothering me.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.920
 It is, of course, the lack of features as well.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.080
 The lack of face tracking, the lack of eye tracking

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.840
 does bother me sometimes.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.720
 But mostly what I want is a lightweight headset

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.960
 that doesn't fall apart.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.680
 And that also includes the controllers,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.640
 because you know what index controllers are like.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.520
 The current ones I'm using are battered.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.680
 They are very battered.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.960
 I think the capacitive touch on the joystick is going,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.160
 but they're not drifting yet.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.360
 So I still use them, because the joystick drift

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.280
 hasn't happened yet.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.880
 So there's no reason to sort of change them over.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.080
 The capacitive is done on the joystick, though.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.880
 I do have a fresh set that are unused.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.440
 I think I used them for like an hour,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.720
 just to make sure they work.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.120
 They're in my cupboard.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.960
 And I will switch to those at the moment,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.480
 like really bad joystick drifts sets in on those.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.920
 When I say battered, like you know

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.360
 the curve of the outside of the top?

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.720
 There's like a curve there.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.840
 It's quite a sharp curve.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.240
 That's been like rubbed away.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.280
 And I can see like--

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.640
 it's just-- it looks like someone's

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.400
 taking sandpaper around all of the edges

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.800
 of the current controllers.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.840
 I don't remember how much the big screen weighs,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.720
 but I think it's like a third less or something like that,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.640
 or 2/3 less.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.040
 It's a big, big, big decrease in weight.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.160
 You don't realize how much weight is the problem,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.040
 but it is there.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.040
 I've always wondered why they're so weighty.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.360
 Like I don't know why more of the processing

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.640
 isn't at the other end of the cable.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.000
 When you remember the original Vive had that link box.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.280
 It's like, why?

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.880
 Why?

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.760
 Look at any other system.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.960
 A monitor, for example.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.920
 Monitors are quite thin these days.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.080
 They're connected to a beast of a computer,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.640
 but the monitor is quite thin.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.560
 So why is the thing that I strap to my face like really chunky

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.080
 and heavy?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.560
 I don't understand.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.600
 Yeah, there's position tracking and stuff like that,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.600
 but why is that chunky?

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.240
 I don't understand.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.960
 Anyway, so we'll see how that controller works.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.960
 Charlie-san, you're in the wrong thread.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.920
 I will go into the old thread and take a look,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.240
 but you are in the moderation office thread.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.960
 Link asks, did I order the ITI controllers a long time ago?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.440
 Yes.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.560
 I'm actually going to go look that up.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.280
 We've got time.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.480
 Questions levels are a little bit lower.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.520
 I want to just find out when I ordered those controllers,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.080
 because it's getting ridiculous.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.320
 Although, once I find that day, I

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.880
 do admire what the community manager just did.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.600
 I'll talk about that once I get the date.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.120
 Gmail has logged me out for the 20th time this week.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.720
 And to log in, I need to pretty much sacrifice a goat.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:17.200
 Yeah, the order was 2021.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.560
 March 2021 was when I ordered the ITI controllers.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.000
 So what's happening there is they've repeatedly

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 said that they were--

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 sorry, excuse me-- that they were

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.200
 going to be delivering those.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.240
 And then sort of accidentally fallen back on their promises.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.240
 So it was going to be before the end of the year,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.120
 or the community manager said that they were

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.600
 going to eat an ITI controller.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.440
 They didn't actually eat an ITI controller.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.520
 I even gave them outs.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.760
 Like, I DM'd them, and I was like,

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.520
 you could just contact one of those realistic cake makers

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.040
 to make you an ITI controller.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.680
 It'd be a great marketing beat.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.120
 And then you eat it on stream.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.320
 It would be hilarious, but they didn't actually do that.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.280
 They did write a support article on the official ITI support

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.360
 system, which talks about the safety of eating a controller

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.000
 and goes through all the chemicals and materials that

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.440
 make up an ITI controller, which again, I thought was great.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.280
 Again, another sort of good marketing thing.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.280
 But seriously, guys, just make an ITI cake

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.080
 and eat it on stream.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.200
 All of the late they're taking a long time to ship

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.000
 will be forgiven if you do that.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.880
 Just eat a cake on stream that looks like your controllers.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.840
 But anyway, what I mean by the community manager doing good

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.600
 is they've actually updated the shipping estimate to be

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.840
 approximately February and March.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.160
 They didn't give an exact date.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.560
 So instead of saying, by the end of the year,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.880
 they said approximately again.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.280
 So they didn't give an exact date.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.080
 I love that.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.080
 It's good.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.840
 It means that they've recognized that there is a problem

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.400
 and they need to address that problem by continuing

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.680
 to not make assurances and instead give vague stuff.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.440
 It's weird that I'm happy with vague,

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.040
 but it basically means I'm not waiting.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.320
 I'm not clock watching.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.080
 Because before Christmas, I was clock

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.480
 watching all the way through Christmas.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.080
 I'm like, the shipping in December,

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.440
 so I was checking my emails.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.560
 I mean, not actively, but I mean, it was in my brain.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.080
 The thought piece of maybe the empty controllers

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.320
 will be shipping to me.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.440
 But now it's like approximately February, March.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.520
 I don't need to-- it's not part of my brain right now.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.440
 Moving on, Rapper says, do I have a fruity phone?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.840
 Apparently, I need a fruity phone for the big screen thing.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.920
 I would just find someone that's got a big chunky phone

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.080
 if mine's not supported.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.560
 I do have a Pixel 7 Pro that has got more lenses on the back

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.720
 of it than I know what they are.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.440
 But I don't think that's a word.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.440
 I think it needs to be an Apple iPhone.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.480
 It needs to be a particular type of-- it's

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.040
 one of the LIDAR phones.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.520
 It's fine.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.480
 I'll figure it out.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.640
 I'll just be like, yo, friend, you got an iPhone?

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.320
 Cool.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.840
 Yo, foe, yeah, you got an iPhone?

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.840
 Great, thank you.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.920
 I believe we're at the end of questions there.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.120
 I don't think I've missed any.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:42.920
 I will scroll up.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.120
 Oh, no, I'll have to look in the moderation thread for do you

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.120
 believe you.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.480
 So Charlie sent in the wrong thread,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.120
 but I let them know previously.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.320
 If you want a good lightweight pair of headphones,

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.880
 try the still serious Arctis 3s.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.720
 I actually don't have a problem with headphones.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.800
 I've had a Bose QC35 since roughly 2016.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.920
 I love them.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.720
 With the idea that they die, I will immediately

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.160
 purchase another pair of Bose QC35s,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.120
 because they are amazing headphones.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.400
 I don't use the index's on-ear headphones.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.400
 I immediately unscrewed those.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.680
 For those who don't know, it's just a small screw,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.720
 and then they pop off.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.720
 And then I use QC35s.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.520
 I found that the on-ear headphones leaked audio

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.920
 into the microphone for the index,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.720
 whereas using the QC35s doesn't.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.400
 And I just can't stand leaked audio.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.520
 If I notice leaked audio from myself,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.760
 I will mute myself immediately in whatever voice channel it is,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.680
 and then spend the next 20 hours fixing it,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.200
 because it's just personal gripe of mine.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.960
 Sorta's talking about the edible stuff

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.000
 they use to make things look realistic.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.440
 And they said that Raval almost need natural controller.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.000
 You're right.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.520
 They usually use fondant for those cakes.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.920
 And it's gross.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.240
 Fondant is-- in large quantities, it's gross.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.960
 The problem with those realistic cakes is a lot of times,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.840
 they have to make up a bulk, or some of the sculptures,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.120
 or some edges, or something with fondant, which

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.440
 is basically like sugar clay.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.880
 And it doesn't taste very nice.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.400
 But the point about a cake, for me at least,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.600
 is that it has to actually be cake in it.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.120
 But with those realistic cakes, it's

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.960
 a lot of just fondant painting.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.040
 It's still a skill, and they're still great,

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.360
 but you don't want to eat them.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360
 I guess it's also like--

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.360
 I don't know if people will have this sort of memory.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.640
 But growing up when you had birthday cakes,

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.520
 you might have had one of those ones that had--

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.840
 it's just a generic white cake that's been iced.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.560
 But it had balloons that were put on top of it.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.680
 Those balloons were usually fondant.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.280
 And I would always, as a kid, I was like, cool.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.120
 I want a piece that's got one of the balloons on it.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.440
 But the balloon was basically just taking the icing

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.120
 and doubling the thickness of the icing,

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.240
 because it was on top of the regular icing, which

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.960
 meant the fondant layer was double.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.760
 And as a kid, I quickly realized that wasn't a good idea.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.240
 I'm like, I want a middle piece as far away from the balloons

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.280
 as possible.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.280
 I just searched like, "perfect cake" on Google Images,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.160
 and I can't find the stereotypical balloons

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.000
 I'm talking about.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.720
 There's also ones where the balloons are printed,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.540
 but the ones I used to get from the bakery by my family

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.640
 were always fondant balloons in the corners and stuff

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.000
 like that.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.320
 Sort of was trying to forget the fondant balloons.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.800
 Yep.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.080
 No, I remember them.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.080
 I remember one time I had a chocolate cake.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.160
 People are saying they don't like chocolate cake.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.120
 It's like they wanted carrot cake for their birthdays.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.520
 They can't stand chocolate.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.160
 Yeah, I like cakes that are not as iced as they need to be.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.320
 Or different types of icing.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.560
 There are multiple different types of icing.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.080
 Here you go.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.600
 It's like this sort of thing.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.720
 It's like the balloons are just like triple or double

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.000
 the thickness of the regular icing.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.480
 Got any more near-us questions?

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.760
 Or we're just going to end up talking about cake

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.820
 for another five minutes?

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.160
 I just missed a call.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.400
 I don't know who that is.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.660
 If I don't know the number, I literally

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.080
 won't answer the phone these days.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.920
 It's just like, cool.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.080
 There's one above I missed.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.960
 Oh, I got it.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.640
 Yes, thank you.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.500
 Thank you for pointing that out.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.240
 Specs, I'm sorry I missed your question.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.320
 Specs says, our MMC entry is going to be submitted.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.660
 We're going to work on a dev branch copy for future updates

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.480
 after judgment.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.060
 How can one overwrite a published world

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.560
 with a different separate version for the future?

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.100
 You shouldn't do that.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.800
 You should leave the MMC one as the MMC one

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.680
 and then produce a version two.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.140
 Or at least that's the preference that we have.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.300
 The goal is to sort of preserve a moment in time

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.140
 of what you achieved in a month.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.100
 And then if you need to expand on that work,

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.540
 make it a separate copy.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.480
 They also do that with the credit jam worlds.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.960
 They will save the credit jam world

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.940
 at the end of the credit jam.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.980
 That is what they achieved in that weekend.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.900
 And then they'll create like a remix world, which is

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.900
 where they then expand on that.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.500
 Mamie asks, how many MMC submissions

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.620
 have been published so far?

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.640
 Lex answers with 101.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.740
 We know that there isn't the like facet

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.500
 on the side of the world browser updated yet.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.940
 But if you go ahead and you just search for--

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.860
 no, wait, that's last year.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.880
 If you put plus MMC 23 into your world browser search bar,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.940
 it will restrict your entries to anything

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.620
 which is appropriately tagged.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.980
 By the way, that's the whole reason that the MMC tag needs

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.820
 to be in there exactly as we specify it.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.300
 It's so that that particular search works.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.020
 Because that's the search that the judges use and also

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.180
 that the voting system uses to find your entry.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.660
 And so if you put, I don't know, MMC 28,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.540
 we're not going to be able to find it until 2028.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.720
 Rade says, I saw a couple of worlds that had quotations

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.720
 like MMC 23.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.220
 Yeah, Medra needs to do that.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.580
 They need to remove the quotations from the tags.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.360
 They should still show up correctly

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.860
 because we strip punctuation in some places.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.900
 But it needs to be plus MMC 23.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.440
 What that means when you do plus MMC 23 is the search result

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.340
 must contain the tag MMC 23.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.620
 That's what the plus means.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.900
 And that's just how we do it.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.200
 And then the tags there are used for bucketing entries

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.620
 into the various categories we've got

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.260
 and also for bucketing them into the list.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.420
 So make sure they're correct.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.780
 If you're not sure, you'll be able to check the voting

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.900
 system once it's live.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.620
 Which, of course, it'll be too late then.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.660
 So maybe check the world browser before that.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.260
 But yeah.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.580
 Rampa says, can't we just run a script that force fix

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.260
 his tags on the backend?

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.140
 No.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.940
 Because the MMC is not a Neos competition.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.300
 The MMC is made by a third party company called CreatorJam.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.640
 And so while Neos the team does a lot of stuff

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.780
 to help out the MMC, we have to put a limit on that.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.740
 And so the limit that we kind of put is,

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.060
 let's not do anything special for the MMC.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.420
 Let's not do anything in addition for that.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.940
 Of course, the world browser button is an exception,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.460
 of course.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.180
 But what we don't want to get into the habit of

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.340
 is for this company or this third party event,

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.660
 we do special stuff.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.860
 And then for this third party company or thing,

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.140
 we don't do special stuff.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.740
 Because that just gets problematic.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.100
 That's why other platforms will, in some cases,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.780
 like charge for additional features.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.620
 So they're trying to sort of make it a level playing field.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.660
 It's weird.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.420
 It basically just sort of sets up expectations.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.380
 If we did a bunch of custom work for the MMC,

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.700
 then we should also do that bunch of custom work

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.900
 for any other event that exists.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.300
 Yeah, and if your tags are wrong,

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.180
 it's actually on you.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.220
 It's not on us.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.740
 It's entirely your fault. You have a month

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.220
 to submit your entry and to double check it

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.020
 and to ask us if you're unsure.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.140
 Moving forward to additional questions that we have,

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.220
 Riggs says, will they be dragging into folders

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:28.580
 in the future?

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.460
 I think yes.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.940
 You can take a look at our roadmap boards.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.380
 I don't remember which roadmap board it's on.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.860
 But one of the roadmap boards there

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.780
 will have better--

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.660
 Neos Public Crunchings.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.980
 Crunchings Classic.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.100
 There we go.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.100
 One of those has an item for updating the file browser.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.460
 It also has things for dark mode.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.420
 It also has things for better UI, more tutorials,

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.860
 more documentation, et cetera.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.300
 Whilst you're waiting for that, I

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.180
 do want you to take just a little bit of time,

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.820
 especially if you're a Logix developer

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.500
 or you make anything inside of Neos,

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.820
 just imagine how difficult it is to make an inventory system

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.660
 where you are able to do that.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.180
 Take for granted the fact that it even works on Windows.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.180
 It is a very complicated problem.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.500
 I want to eventually get the world browser to a state

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.140
 where it's similar and not identical to-- so just

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.060
 hear the word similar.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.980
 Don't quote me as being identical to--

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.500
 similar to things like the Twitch front page or the Steam

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.420
 store front page, where it's not really even up

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.980
 to engineering what goes on there.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.140
 Engineering, of course, have made sort of squares.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.340
 And the squares have different functionality,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.260
 but it's up to sort of like a marketing team or a marketing

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.380
 person to decide what goes on there.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.020
 I know that's how it works, because I

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.420
 used to work for Mixer, and that's

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.220
 how we made the front page on Mixer works.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.900
 Basically, we were like, cool, you want a featured category.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.580
 It's in a featured game box.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.060
 Cool.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.540
 We have made that box for you.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.740
 What is in that box?

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.300
 When that box appears, when that box disappears,

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.820
 it is entirely up to you.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.140
 Don't ask us about it.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.220
 Here's how you do it.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.700
 If you have any difficulty using the tooling, we can help you.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.860
 But it's not up to us which games get featured.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.300
 And that's what I wanted to do.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.820
 I also want to get to the point where

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.100
 we don't have to do an update to update that.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.580
 Say we wanted to do Thursdays at 3 o'clock,

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.980
 we showcase cheese worlds with a cheese world banner.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.420
 Then great, that just happens.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.300
 We don't need to do a code update for that.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.980
 I don't know how world overwrites works,

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.140
 actually, unfortunately.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.900
 There is a bug open that says that world overwrites don't

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.220
 work, but they do.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.540
 I think I made an update on that when I figured out

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.460
 how it worked.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.020
 But then I still think that was a bug.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.900
 And so I haven't actually used it successfully,

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:38.820
 so I don't know.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.340
 There we go.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.700
 So Ozzy can tell you how.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.540
 It's all on you.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.820
 All the fingers now point to Ozzy.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.420
 All of them.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.020
 I was thinking for world paths, I

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.700
 went on a three hour expedition into the source code

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.740
 to figure out world paths.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.100
 Couldn't figure it out.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.380
 Asked Fruks, he gave me an answer that I didn't understand.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.060
 And so I need to go back to Fruks and ask,

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.540
 but I haven't done that yet.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.540
 Yeah, that's pretty much what's going on.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.620
 Same with cloud variables.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.340
 You'll notice on the cloud variable documentation,

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.660
 there's a bunch of sort of like--

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.700
 Prime doesn't know what's going on here,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.140
 because Prime kept making mistakes

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.260
 in the documentation there.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.820
 Speaking about myself and third person's weird,

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:13.900
 but you know what I mean.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.900
 I kept making mistakes on how cloud variables worked.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.540
 And so I just blanked out some of them.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.300
 And I'm like, look, I've got to look at these later.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.860
 If people want to look at them and figure them out,

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.540
 they're free to update the documentation.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.420
 But there we go.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.380
 Also, that reminds me, for anyone here,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.220
 cloud variables are fine.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.260
 We had someone in another one of the Discords

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.060
 here that said they were told to avoid cloud variables

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.140
 for some reason because they were quote "bad" or something.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.060
 They're fine.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.140
 Use them.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.300
 And for anyone here that has been telling other people

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.660
 that various features are bad for some reason, stop it.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.300
 Stop.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.580
 People are like, logics is bad.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.260
 Stop.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.900
 Components are-- stop.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.220
 Yeah, it's really weird.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.300
 It's like-- a lot of people say--

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.260
 like I said, a lot of people say use components, not logic.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.180
 But then, I'm like, logic is components.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.820
 And then the whole reality is shattered.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.100
 Just use whatever works for you.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.500
 I'm tired of reading, like, is there a component

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.700
 to add two numbers together?

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.780
 Yes, the plus node in logics.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.380
 Also, use the sort of principle of pack often, pack early,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.020
 when it comes to that, stuff like that.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.060
 People go like, but they're not have

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.580
 to get logic, sir, and stuff like that

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.740
 to add two numbers together.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.300
 Yeah, do it.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.260
 Make a two node chain that adds two numbers together.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.700
 Pack it into the same slot those components are on.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:22.200
 You're done.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.060
 You never have to unpack that logic again.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.940
 I do it all the time.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.820
 I even have logics that purely updates properties

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.780
 on components because I'm lazy.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.140
 One that I'll often do is something

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:38.660
 along the lines of the slot name drives the variable

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.940
 name of a dynamic variable.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.380
 So let's say you had a dynamic variable prefix of world,

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.580
 because you're using the world dynamic variable space

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.100
 like that.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.620
 And then you make a slot called cheese.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.620
 I then sometimes have on that cheese slot,

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.540
 I've got like a dynamic variable value.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.220
 And for the variable name, I just

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.500
 do world plus slot name in logics.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.860
 And then it's like, cool.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.580
 Now, whatever I name this slot, wherever I put this slot,

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.020
 it just works.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.300
 Anyway, I'm tired of ranting about that one,

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.740
 but basically, just stop telling people not to use features.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.100
 Like if there is a feature that we shouldn't be using,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.260
 put it in the announcements.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.780
 There is the things to avoid list,

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.020
 but that's things to avoid.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.700
 And the way you need to think about that

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.540
 is doctors will tell you to avoid alcohol,

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.540
 to avoid eating giant cheese garlic breads that I'm still

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.980
 going to try and find today.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.420
 They'll tell you to avoid too much caffeine,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.300
 avoid too much sugar, but you're still going to eat the cake.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.460
 So it's things to avoid because it's like, hey, I'm Dr. Prime.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.220
 And I say, for your health, you should avoid these things.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.740
 But they do taste good.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.100
 They do taste good.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.540
 Rick says, what foods do I avoid?

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.300
 Bread, strangely.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.980
 There's this video and principle--

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.380
 this is getting way off the weeds.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.700
 We'll close in just a moment.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:59.820
 But there's this thing called changing your behavior

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.540
 by changing your environment.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.700
 And it's more effective than just changing your behavior.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.500
 For example, if you need to go to the gym

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.860
 but you keep not being able to go to the gym,

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.020
 you put your alarm clock on top of your gym bag, which

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.580
 is packed and ready to go.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.500
 And then to turn off your alarm, you

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.900
 have to touch your gym bag.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.300
 And then you've already got your gym bag in your hands.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.780
 And so you've changed your behavior

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.140
 by changing your environment.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.760
 You've got everything ready, and you've

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.180
 given yourself an environment that

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.980
 condenses going to the gym.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.300
 I do that a lot with food.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.140
 So if I buy a loaf of bread, I know

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.140
 I'm going to find excuses to eat it.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.180
 It will go as far as I will just eat bread plain.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.800
 There doesn't need to be anything on it.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.460
 I will just eat it so I don't buy bread.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.080
 And therefore, I can't eat it because it's not in the house.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.740
 I did an experiment because it's been a few years

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.020
 since I bought a loaf of bread.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.180
 I bought a loaf of bread.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.040
 I bought it home.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.900
 It lasted half a day, an entire loaf.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.860
 I would smear things on it.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.140
 I ran out of butter, and so I went to mayonnaise.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.620
 I ran out of mayonnaise, and so I just smeared ketchup on it

00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.860
 and ate it.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.940
 Whatever is there, I will put it on the bread.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.580
 And if there's nothing on the bread available,

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.700
 I'll just eat the bread.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.020
 Sort of just talking about alarms

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.520
 and how that doesn't work in theory.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.100
 I now have this amazing thing where

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:17.660
 I have to scan NFC tags for my alarm to stop,

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.920
 and I can't stop it until these NFC tags are stopped.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.780
 Now, one of them is in the bathroom,

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.780
 and one of them is on top of my water jug, which

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.440
 is in the fridge.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.900
 It's a Brita water filter.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.860
 And so until I scan both of those,

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.980
 the alarm just will not turn off.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.740
 The bathroom one was to sort of encourage

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.620
 me to get out of the bedroom.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.620
 But the water one is like, hey, you've

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.020
 got your hand on the water jug.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.660
 You might as well pour a glass.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.560
 And sometimes I'll leave a fresh glass next to the fridge

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.220
 as well.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.860
 And then I have zero excuse to not just pound a pint of water.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.180
 But there we go.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.220
 Try that if you've got NFC chips lying around.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.920
 I used to do programming with NFC chips.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.660
 Long story.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.360
 Something to do with motors-- fine.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.020
 I'll just carry on.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.740
 I used to work for a motorsports company.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.900
 We wanted to do technical screening of motorcycles,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.780
 but people kept pulling fast ones on us

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.820
 where they would change which motorcycle was being presented

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.540
 for their inspection.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.420
 And because it's a race bike, we can't even

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.300
 do things like plates, like number plates,

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.020
 because number plates.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.980
 I will go through the questions in just a moment,

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.700
 but I'm halfway through the story.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.180
 And then we said, well, we could do VIN numbers.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.140
 I hate when people say VIN numbers, because they're saying

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:31.740
 number number.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.500
 But anyway, we could do VIN numbers,

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.740
 but VIN numbers are usually really small and difficult

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.620
 to read.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.580
 So the way that we did it is we just

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.920
 bought NFC chips that destroyed themselves

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.940
 when they were removed.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.500
 And they got stuck to a part of the bike.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.780
 They were branded to the motorsports organization.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.660
 I wrote code for an Android smartphone application, which

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.460
 would write the vehicle's identification number to it

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.220
 and then lock the tag so it couldn't be manipulated.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.460
 And there we go.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.300
 And it was great.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.080
 So in developing that, I have like 100 or so NFC tags left.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.540
 I think there's a bag somewhere with like 500 in them,

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.780
 but I don't know where that is.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.220
 I've got 100 of easy access ones.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.820
 So that's why they're just like all around my apartment.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.060
 Anyway, I'm going to go back to questions,

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.220
 and then we will leave off.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.060
 We'll try and stay on topic.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.460
 No more cakes, no more motorcycles, no more bread.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.620
 So just scrolling up to make sure I'm not

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.100
 missing any questions.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.080
 Lex says, is anything going to happen with Neos'

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.140
 coffee in the future?

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.540
 Or coffee, as I sometimes say it,

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.300
 so people don't get confused.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.300
 Coffee is another funding source that we have where

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.000
 you can do a one-time donation.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.920
 We were going to hook it up so that it made sugar cubes.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.700
 I don't remember-- the sugar cube thing

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:43.860
 is the whole before my time.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.380
 But it was meant to be that if you did a coffee donation,

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.780
 you would then get some sugar cubes.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.320
 When I was new to Neos, I thought

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.280
 that donating via coffee was the thing that

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.940
 got you the coffee badge.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.080
 And so I donated using coffee to Neos

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.380
 to see if it would give me the coffee badge, and it doesn't.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.660
 But I only gave them like $5, so it's fine.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.980
 And back then, it was--

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.300
 I wasn't even on the team, so that's fine.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.740
 So yes, in the future, pending stuff and announcements.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.700
 La-tida.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.940
 Greg says, is there a public repository of things

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.140
 that people have already made, like quality of life things?

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.820
 There isn't a public repository.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.300
 You can get a way of just asking people,

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.500
 or you can get away with a tool called

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.420
 RedX, which allows you to search through things

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.140
 that people made.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.900
 Like, if you load RedX and you put in, I don't know,

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.540
 multi-tool, you'll probably just die,

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.780
 because it's going to be like four pages or something.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.940
 But that's all we've really got.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.700
 Eventually, we'll sort of get an inkling for it.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.180
 We do want to make that better.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:44.300
 That will be in the Marketplace sort of tools update thing,

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.900
 where you can kind of see, and we'll

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.820
 be able to categorize items down a little bit,

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.020
 so you'll be able to see there.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.980
 And again, the front page of that Marketplace,

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.780
 I want to be entirely marketing driven.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.460
 So if they want to have--

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.940
 this week, we're going to do a special on featuring hats.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.820
 And the entire front page of the Marketplace

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.540
 is just like a feature of hats in a square.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:06.100
 Again, just offload that kind of stuff from engineering.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.500
 Make it so that someone who isn't engineering

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.460
 has a button to push.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.340
 They're like, I'd like to feature hats today,

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.540
 and it just appears.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.780
 I think I blocked sending sugar cubes, simply because it's not

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.900
 that it's a problem.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.140
 It's that it's an unfinished feature.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.740
 And so if you guys keep sending them, and then we finish it

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.660
 or remove it, it creates a dependence on something

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.660
 that we might remove.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.220
 And so we don't want to do that.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.020
 With that, I think we're done on questions.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.620
 So avoid talking about other random stuff.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:36.460
 Oh, there we go.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.060
 There's a question.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.860
 Aaron asked, what the fuck are sugar cubes?

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.540
 So sugar cubes were meant to be a unique thing,

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.780
 a physical object that was sent to you when

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.700
 you made a Ko-fi donation.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.780
 I don't particularly know why that was a good idea or even

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.340
 an idea, but it never got implemented.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.980
 There are bits of it still lying around,

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.180
 and hell knows why it's there.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.180
 I found in the code base the other day--

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.540
 apparently it's public knowledge,

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.620
 so I don't mind saying it--

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.020
 we were going to have stickers in contact messages,

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.660
 like stickers in Telegram and in Discord now.

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:12.540
 We were going to have stickers inside messaging

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.500
 with inside Neos.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.020
 And there wasn't code added for them,

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.900
 but there were graphics added for them.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.860
 And they are basically larger versions of the Neos emojis

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.900
 there.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.860
 Got more questions.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.620
 So specs and rampa, you are the last two questions

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.660
 I'll accept, OK?

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.620
 I've got to get going.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.340
 I've got to do other stuff, things.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.060
 Yeah, OK?

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.980
 Nami, no.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.020
 No question.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.380
 You can still type, though, Nami.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.220
 I'm not preventing you from typing.

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.700
 Just no question.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.860
 OK, so Terra says, I noticed that there

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.020
 was a tool for making curves in the Scratch space world,

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.100
 but it's not in the essential tools folder.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:44.380
 Why not?

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.020
 It's broken.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.220
 We're probably going to remove it or fix it.

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.460
 It's very broken.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.460
 It's a tool from 2013.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.620
 It's very, very broken.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.820
 Rig says, I was looking at the Patreon,

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.580
 and I saw that there was one mention that

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.260
 was being on the board.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.580
 Is there a board on who is on it?

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.140
 That is a misleading statement, which I have asked

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.060
 to be removed multiple times.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.940
 That Patreon tier will give you access

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.300
 to a once a month meeting, which is currently not being held,

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.580
 where you can speak to all of us.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.100
 That's it.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.220
 It's not being on the board.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.740
 There is no paperwork.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.780
 As for who is on the board, there is no board.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.060
 I mean, sure, there kind of is.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.780
 Like, technically-- well, actually, not technically,

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.580
 because it's long story read announcements.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.900
 Hypothetically, there are three people

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.020
 on the board, which are all the people with C-level suite

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.060
 titles.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.900
 Hypothetically is all they'll say.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.340
 Hypothetically.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.820
 Hand waving, jazz hands, moving onwards.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.260
 Aaron says, why were they removed?

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.340
 If you're referring to the stickers,

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.300
 they were never implemented.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.900
 You're referring to the sugar cubes,

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.980
 they were also never implemented.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.300
 And that's it.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.820
 Yeah, last week-- OK, so the problem

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.340
 with generating transcripts is I've

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.860
 noticed my CPU said spiking.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.900
 And so if I'm doing anything active on my computer,

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.380
 I can't generate the transcript.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.860
 And so I was just busy for the entire week.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.740
 So I didn't have a chance to run it.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.300
 I did run it when I fell asleep yesterday, though.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.420
 I was like, well, my computer's on.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.940
 So my computer's on, so I might as well run it.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.500
 But I will run this one straight after,

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:20.100
 because I should just be doing low CPU activities after this,

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.860
 like getting a giant glass of water,

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.780
 because I've been talking a lot about stuff that

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.860
 isn't Neos related.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.500
 We're going to leave off there and not take any more questions.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.740
 If you have any additional questions past this,

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.460
 please drop them in the Questions Help channel,

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.460
 DM me, open GitHub issues, open moderation tickets

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.300
 if you have an issue.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.740
 I will see you again next week.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.060
 Maybe we need to start a second prime time where

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.740
 I don't talk about Neos, and that way I
