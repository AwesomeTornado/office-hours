00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
Okay, welcome to Prime Time, which is the office hours, or AMA with Prime.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.760
For questions about Neos, please drop your questions in the office hours chat if you

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760
have any questions.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.200
Otherwise we're going to sit here in unimaginably uncomfortable silence until there are questions.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.400
Okay, our first question is from Storm, and unfortunately not something I can answer.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.000
So Storm asks, how does Neos generate light colour and brightness using a skybox?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.840
I have no idea, that's a question for games.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.840
I can guess, and I know technically what I would do to set up a world to look like how

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.880
I would want it to look, but I don't know with enough technical detail to answer that

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.080
correctly.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080
So I won't.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.720
Alright, we have another question from Mystic, as noted, we can have awkward silence when

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.640
there are no questions, that's just how office hours go!

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.640
So the question is from Mystic, how is documentation going as of recent, and as far as Patreon

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.040
section goes, there's a few ways it's phrased, patron benefits to patron tiers.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:12.040
If you see something that is not unified, then you're free to unify it.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.440
It's a wiki, like so many people are like, I can't edit the wiki, I'm a lowly person

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.140
in the metaverse, so anyone can edit the wiki, if you want to go for it, there's no planned

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.520
updates to the Patreon, there probably will be a big update eventually, but like, you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.200
know, that will be once we get more things cleared up.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.800
As for like generically documentation, honestly, lots of stuff is on pause, we're still working

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.560
on the stuff that we can work on, other stuff we can't work on, see announcements.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.520
Yeah, we're not working on big update marketplace, for example.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.520
So that's that question.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.040
Moving onwards, NFThater has a question here, which is, oh, I should just, the answer to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.040
the question about graphics and rendering, yeah, it's asking, I have no idea.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.240
I know what I would do if I was building a particular world for a particular scene, but

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.160
I don't know technically how it's done.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.420
There is a lot of stuff like that in Neos, where I'm like, I don't know technically how

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.960
this works, but if you just like, tinker with it, then you'll figure it out.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.840
Like for example here, like particle systems, people ask, like, have you done a tutorial

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.180
on particle systems yet?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.840
And I always say like, no, and the reason is honestly, because I just tinker with all

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.520
the values until it looks right.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.680
So moving back to NFThater's question now, I know I'm circling around a little bit.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.920
Is it possible to browse the web in Neos?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.440
There is a roadmap item for that, it includes in-game documentation that won't require browsing

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.680
the web, that's something I'm super excited about, but there will also be a way to sort

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.640
of like view web pages and share them with other users in Neos eventually, so two things

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.640
there.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.000
First one is to go look at the documentation roadmap on our GitHub that has a lot of sort

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.240
of things that we want to do there, and then secondarily go ahead and look at screen sharing

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.200
which will allow you to sort of drop screens in the world.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.480
Honestly though, I would rather right now, you just use the desktop tab of your dash,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.760
access overlay, desktop plus, OVR toolkit, so many different tools that can just drop

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.880
documentation into the world.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.880
They are a bit clunky, like they're all a bit clunky, honestly the best way would be,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.240
I don't know what this is going to look like, but like you know, you click on a logics node

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.000
and somehow, some way it's just like, yo dude, this is how this logics node works, like you

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.200
wouldn't need to go to the wiki or anything like that, we know what node you're selecting,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.640
what node your laser is on, we can just display the documentation for that particular node.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.760
So that solves that problem better.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.760
So there you go.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.880
Mystic asks, there's been an update in regards to your favorite cheese, I don't answer cheese

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.080
questions at these office hours, these are about Neos.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.000
There is an AMA, but to be honest I get the cheese question every office hours and I'm

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.840
kind of tired of answering it, so I don't answer cheese questions, like go read the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840
previous notes.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.880
So we have another cheese related question, I don't answer cheese related questions.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.080
The mood of silence shouldn't be bad, it's always important to remember that office hours

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.760
in academia, which is what these are loosely based on, are literally the professor saying

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.000
my door is open, come visit me.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.560
And if no one visits them, they just drink a cup of tea, put their feet up on the couch

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.280
and relax, eat some cheese maybe, so that's the way it is, right?

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.000
An AMA is only an AMA when there are questions, if there are no questions, they don't happen,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.640
they just happen to be voice related.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.440
We have another question from Crusher here, which says is the performance impact of updating

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.280
relays significant?

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.860
Less than you would think.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.160
The advice I have for updating relays is use them if you think you need to use them, but

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.960
once your logic is complete, try to remove them.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.040
A lot of problems I see with users and updating relays is when they use them with the transform

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.000
nodes, and then they have an impulse chain.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.560
If you have an impulse chain that reads from the transform nodes, you often don't need

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.960
the updating relay.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.960
It's difficult to explain about pictures and stuff like that, but there are lots of cases

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.160
where people use an updating relay just so that the display node that they're using updates.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.880
In impulse flows, you don't need the display node, and so therefore you don't need it to

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.760
update all the time, and you know that on an actual impulse, it will have the appropriate

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.920
update.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.680
So hence my feedback of build the logics using the updating relay, and then consider removing

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.360
it and seeing if the logic still works, and then you've evaluated if they're needed or

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360
not.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.820
That also leads to the second thing about that, which is if you need them, you need

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.820
them.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.900
There is no way around it, so just add them, but make sure you do need them by building

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.720
your logics and then removing them.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.360
Mattie asks, updating relay refers to the specific node type and not the little logics

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.840
needing block you get by grabbing a wire.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.360
Those don't have an impact.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.960
They do have an impact to slot count, but I'm going to say this incredibly loudly.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.600
Slots do not matter.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.280
The reason I say that is because high slot avatars, it's often not the problem that they

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280
have lots of slots.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.520
The reason that they have lots of slots is because they've put lots of functionality

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.840
in the avatar.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.720
If you put less functionality in your avatar, then there will be less slots.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.360
So think about functionality before slots, basically.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.480
I've seen people that are like, you know, here's like a nuclear power plant of data

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.080
above my head in my name badge, none of which is useful to me.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.000
Like, here's the time in my time zone, somewhat useful, here's the FPS, here's my heart rate,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.280
here's my heart rate availability, here's my favorite type of cheese, here's the temperature

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.240
that exists in my time zone, here's my CPU rendering time, my battery percentage, none

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.520
of which of course they can see because it's above in their name badge.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.160
I don't care what your batteries are, if they run out, you can, cool, go charge them.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.240
So just consider what features you're putting into an object and then your slot count will

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.320
naturally go down and then they won't matter.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.680
So relays, no problem, updating relays, test if you need them at the end of your logics.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.600
So next we have a question from Revy who says, how do Patreon rewards get handled when you

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600
cancel Patreon?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.720
Heard from some that you get to keep your storage tier, I want to know if it's true.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.480
Asking since as far as I know, all the Patreon money still goes to Carol, which not something

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.720
I want to support for a while now.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.800
I've been meaning to, I keep forgetting to due to current circumstances and volunteers,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.800
et cetera, update the Patreon page to just clarify that statement, you know, what happens

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.320
when you stop doing Patreon.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:37.520
What I will know and will can tell you is that we never delete data.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.440
So we're never going to delete stuff.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.120
If you, for example, have a storage tier that gives you 40 gigabytes and you use all 40

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.200
gigabytes, we're never going to delete that data, we're going to let you keep it.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.960
You won't be able to write, but you will be able to read.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.260
You don't use the appropriate technology there.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.360
The next billing cycle, you'll lose the storage.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.360
Certain things like groups will not be removed.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.180
The Patreon badge will also not be removed, neither will the wizard badge.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.480
You keep a lot of stuff, but like other stuff that we actually have to pay money for, i.e.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.640
the storage, doesn't go away.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.840
So if we have to pay for it, it probably goes away.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.840
If we don't have to pay for it, it doesn't.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.600
Moving onwards to the next question, is there like a tutorial series for new users?

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.760
Basically no clue to use it.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.400
There are multiple tutorial series.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.960
It depends on which one you want to see.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.520
I have 300 tutorials, but something which I don't do, almost sort of as a principle

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.040
of my channel, is I don't do introduction series.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.840
The reason I haven't done introduction yet is because I want to wait until things like

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.240
the UI update, the logics update are all done.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.880
Because otherwise my introduction series is going to be out of date.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.400
And if my introduction series is going to be out of date, it's going to be monumentally

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.880
more frustrating than other tutorials that could be out of date.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.960
For example, if my how to make a gun in Neos tutorial is out of date, you would need to

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.160
know how to use Neos from an introductory basic point of view before you even start

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.560
making a gun, so you're more malleable and able to deal with stuff being out of date.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.480
I have quite a few videos on my channel, for example, that use the old dash, and people

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.600
can kind of still figure out what's going on and map it to the new UI because they're

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.080
familiar and because it's not a new introductory series.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.000
They're less prone to being affected by changes or being out of date.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.480
Whereas an introductory series will be out of date very quickly, because it needs to

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.880
be day one, week one, moment one, and it needs to be as clear as possible in that regard.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.620
And I can't give that clarity right now, so it hasn't been done.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.840
Other users have done introductory tutorials.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.840
You can look them up.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:49.920
I actually have a link in the guideline, the info and welcome and links channel of this

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.920
Discord, which links to a variety of channels which have tutorials.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.640
There's also a lot of tutorials in game made by various people.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.280
Some of those were MMC entries that talk you through it.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.880
Really though, if we don't have an official introductory series, my question usually there

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.480
is what would you like to know, and then I can sort of narrow it down a little bit.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.920
There is no possible way for you to know everything.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.320
I promise you, you'll never know everything.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320
It's not possible.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.240
I guess that helps.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.640
If you have any particular areas, let me know.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.000
I can follow up with some links from them.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.300
Specs asks, to follow up on the Patreon question, are you intended to keep the herdless server

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.560
binary access of Patreon membership is canceled?

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.940
I don't know either way, yes or no.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.300
I don't know why we still have that lock behind Patreon.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.080
I'd like to review that.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.640
I don't know why many of our test features are locked behind Patreon.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.240
Testing things should be free.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.040
I don't understand.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.360
Neos won't prevent you from using files you've already acquired.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.040
So you don't need to delete it or anything.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.160
I also think it's problematic for like headless server operators, that they're like, well,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.600
I need to have a Patreon access to run servers for Neos, even though I'm not playing Neos,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.160
I'm just running servers for it.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.380
So I don't know.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.380
We need to review that.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.620
We just can't right now, given the circumstances.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.180
I would love that for like we just had it open.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.380
It would put more interest and more attention on that, but that's fine.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.680
That's what testing is for.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.680
Like remember danger testers?

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.480
It was like, hey, guys, we need testers to test this broken build.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.480
People are like, cool, here's a broken build.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.960
Let's test it and let's give feedback.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.960
It's good.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.960
I don't understand.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.040
Anyway, let's not encourage that, because you should, you know, maybe at least once

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.440
get that code.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.040
Do remember that the Patreon money is actually going towards server costs, and we do need

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.080
those server costs to keep your storage.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.240
So yes, while you're uncertain about where your Patreon money is going right now, some

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.700
of it at least does go for paying for the literal file storage that keeps your stuff

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.120
on our systems.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.760
And so if everyone cancelled their Patreon, we might get to the point where we would actually

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.160
start losing access to data.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160
I don't mean losing data.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.880
I just mean losing access to data.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.920
What I mean by that is if you don't pay for the storage, the storage providers will usually

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:15.800
do things like read only, a bit like we do, or here, download it, but you can't access

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.120
it dynamically through APIs, which we do on the cloud systems.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.680
They're not going to delete it either.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.480
At least not initially.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.840
Just keep that in mind.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:32.960
Like, hey, you've got thousands of gigabytes of fursonas or avatars on your cloud storage,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.880
and you don't pay for Patreon, then who's paying for that storage?

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.880
Just think about that.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.520
Moving onwards for more questions, then FTI to ask if they're fursonic-cute, yeah, that's

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.520
a good one.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:50.000
Next question from Fuzzy Foot asks, Fox, sorry, not Foot, Fuzzy Fox, I'm so sorry.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.080
Fuzzy Fox asks, what is the laggiest component or node you know of?

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.320
Go to my public folder, go inside art.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.300
Inside there you'll see a sort of RGB sphere.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.320
That is a piece of artwork I made, hence why it's in the art folder.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:15.160
It uses an ancient component, a component which I do not recommend using.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.120
It is probably the laggiest one I know of.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.480
You won't notice it if you spawn the artwork in private, like by yourself.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.480
Hence why it's there, but in sessions you'll quickly notice it's causing queued packets.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:36.060
We have another new question from Scant, who says, can a slot transform be forcefully updated

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.360
before the end of a frame, such as raycast, rather?

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.200
This is another thing where like Neos wizards and I will disagree.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.320
You shouldn't worry about frames.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.920
If you're worrying about like update cycles, positioning, timing, that's something for

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.080
us to fix.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.120
I don't know.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.560
That's again a sort of like rendering thingy or just sort of like an update cycle thing.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.880
If you could maybe ask about your problem or seeing that prompted that question, I might

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880
be able to help.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.440
But like I see people worrying about like, you know, frames, data, things like that.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.200
You shouldn't be too worried about stuff like that.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.440
So scan has updated their question, which says I have switched from using raycast one

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.640
to raycast drivers as they have better filtering, however I notice the result is behind by one

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.840
frame since it is driving on slot transformations.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:30.600
I would encourage you to always use the tools which make the like thing you're trying to

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.680
build as effective as possible.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.960
Like don't, for example, if someone was reading this and they're seeing what they're reading

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.240
from scan and they're like, hey, I want to swap to raycast driver now as well, don't.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.000
If raycast one is helping you, do it.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.740
If raycaster is helping you, do it.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.360
If raycast driver is helping you, do it, and then we'll figure out what's going on there.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:58.040
As for the actual question, which deals with the result being behind by one frame, I don't

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040
know.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.840
I would have to come into Neos and take a look at your actual problem.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.980
Moving onwards, unfortunately, I wish I could help more.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.940
Maybe I can hop into Neos at some point.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.980
Moving onwards, Fuzzy asks, I always worry about things like loops.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.400
I've had experience where such things lag my computer to death.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.160
Is there any way to do loops?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.160
Yes.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160
Have bounded loops.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.840
90% of problems people have with loops are where they are unbounded.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.880
Things like the for loop node, people avoid because they don't understand why it causes

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.800
problems or why it's causing lag.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.800
For loop's fine.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.840
You just need to use it correctly.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.560
People avoid the while node because they're like, oh, it just lags.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.200
You need a bounded loop.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.480
While is perfectly usable.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:48.000
Oftentimes loops are being used sort of inefficiently as well or incorrectly.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.880
You need to figure out the solution that you're trying to solve and if it needs a loop.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.080
There are some times where I see people solving problems in Neos and I look at it and I'm

00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:00.220
like, do you realize you could do that in half the effort with this node, this component,

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:05.120
or just by changing the not what you're doing, but the outlook of the way that you're doing

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.120
it?

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.280
I wish I could condense it into words.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.840
It happens all the time.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.440
I know what I mean.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.040
I know how to build things with that mentality.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.040
I just don't know how to explain that mentality.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.120
Again, if you have a specific loop-related problem, I can take a look at it and tell

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.200
you how I would do it.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.920
Maybe one day there will be a manifesto from Prime about how to build things.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.960
I have been thinking about doing more videos on just building stuff.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.880
You name it, build a gun, build a door.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.280
I was actually quite interested earlier this week in questions and help.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.760
Someone was asking about a door with a pin code or a type pad and then it would open.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760
That would be cool.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.720
Again, that would teach you how I think about building things in Neos.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.520
If you have a specific problem, let me know.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.200
So Tony asks, is there anything that can be done to videos on Neos cutting out about half

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.740
a second before the actual video is over or is that just a case when VLC gets updated?

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.600
Probably when VLC gets updated.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.960
It might also be the video player that you're using.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.140
It also might be a synchronization issue.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.920
So try it in various sizes of sessions, numbers of people, types of video, et cetera.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.920
But the VLC update will be amazing in its ability to stabilize videos.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.920
Tony updates their question.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.680
It seems to happen on any video locally or in a session.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.320
Yeah, VLC update then.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.880
Moving onwards to more questions that have just appeared.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.320
I was blinking and didn't see any and then suddenly two appeared.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.320
Maybe that was my bad.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.360
I might have zoned out for a second, but anyway.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.560
Scan asks, what is the best option for synced timing, the T node?

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.520
No, the T node is implicitly not synced.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.160
If you're talking about animation and you want the animation to be 100% synced with

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.200
other users, you need to use the tween node or the tween component.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.980
The tween node component is the same thing.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.980
It's a long story.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:01.320
It operates in a series of writes, which means it's less likely to be unsynced.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.180
It just depends what you need to do.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.180
Synchronization is a problem.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:12.720
Again, it depends on the problem or the solution.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:19.420
For example, there was a problem in my run through of abandonware, which is MMC 2021,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.720
where you're in the sewers and you have to rotate like a sewer platform around and we

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.720
got out of sync.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:33.200
So they saw the sewer rotation being one rotation and I saw the other one and we couldn't progress

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.760
without one of us dying to like falling in the sewers.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.100
And on reviewing the way that they had built that sewer platform and rotated it, they'd

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.560
done it purely with components.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.300
I had a long story conversation with Comdog about this.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.060
If it is critical to your game, don't use components.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.680
Use logics and use writes because it's going to be problems.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.440
Impulses are like an authority check for your game.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.080
They had the same issue with the clock that they had.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.520
You had to reposition the clock hands to a particular time.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.520
They again used components since they had synchronization issues and also floating point

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.100
precision issues.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:13.420
So again, if they had used logics, they would be able to have a point in time sort of clapper

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.560
board, if you remember old school film clapper boards, like clap, okay, what's the state

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.560
of the clock?

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.560
Is it correct?

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.080
And that would have resolved that issue.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.360
Use impulses wherever you can to synchronize things up, but it does depend on what you're

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.360
doing.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.800
Certainly for things like visual effects or stuff you don't have to interact with, you

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.080
should be using T, and it doesn't actually matter if it's slightly out of sync.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:42.080
A good example here might be wind, stuff floating in the air, particles, rotating clocks, rotating

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.160
things like that, all sorts of stuff like that.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.640
For karaoke, I'd recommend you go to, I think it's a Japanese entry, there's an MMC entry

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:55.560
called perfectly synced karaoke that uses the clock error property of the video player

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.640
to kind of sync it up between people.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:03.400
I know in VRChat they do that by exposing sort of like a sync track and then buttons

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.720
to each user and asking them to sort of push left or right to sort of try and sync it up

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.720
based on the delay.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.800
I don't know how it works, I know it does work, though.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800
So cool.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.400
I'd have to look, karaoke isn't something I've looked into.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:25.640
Moving forwards to the next question, Fuzzy asks, why is using write nodes usually considered

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.640
a bad idea?

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.640
It isn't.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.880
If anyone's telling you write nodes are bad, they need to go away.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.480
Again, you need to use the appropriate mechanism for whatever you're trying to do.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.800
Write nodes are fantastic if you need to synchronize a value across the network.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.400
That's what write nodes are for.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.800
When you are moving your hands around, you are not technically, but essentially you're

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.280
performing a write every millisecond updating, oh, my left hand is over here in relation

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.940
to my fingers and my right hand is over here and my head is positioned this way and my

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.480
voice is at this level.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.600
Those use streams, which aren't really writes, but they are still writes in that they are

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.480
causing network traffic, and that's what a write does, it causes network traffic.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.720
So if you need that value to be synchronized across the network, use writes.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.280
One of the areas where I would consider them a bad idea is actually the opposite answer

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.480
to the question that Scan had about synchronization.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.040
If you don't need something to synchronize, don't use writes.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:27.720
A good example here, it comes up just because my brain's in this area right now, is imagine

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.880
you have a model solar system.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.720
So it's sitting on someone's desk in a wizard tower and it's a model solar system.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.800
So it's got, you know, the little metal things, auroraries, I really think they're called,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:45.960
like I don't know how to spell it, that aurorary, and it's got the planets rotating around it.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.000
You could write sync that, at which point all of those planets in that model would be

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.720
in the same position, but they don't need to be, so just use T or use the spinner component.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.140
It doesn't matter that they're out of sync, it's a visual element in the wizard's tower.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.840
You might want to synchronize instead the animation of the wizard attacking you or the

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.620
animation of a particular puzzle-related element interacting with it.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.400
But if it's just background noise, background objects, T. Another example there would be

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.360
flickering lights at a tutorial on that one recently.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:21.820
It doesn't matter if the lights are flickering out of order, if you need it synchronized

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.800
use writes, if you don't, use T. Another question from Scant who says, is there a write that

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.920
isn't network synced, like needing to do many dynamic operations and only one of the last

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.200
writes are important?

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.800
That's complicated because that depends on the setup again.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.140
What you need to remember is that when an impulse, any time you see a white ribbon,

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.080
that is locally calculated and then the results are propagated.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.720
As an example there, let's say you had a button and then when you pushed it, it set your position

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.880
to be 10 units above where you are, so it's basically like a short range teleport upwards.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.680
It could do maths in the middle there, but then at the end, it will do a set position

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.940
or use that set position node.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.920
That set position node is effectively a write, and what that's doing is it's populating new

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.560
data to the data model.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.600
It's saying, hey, prime, scan, fuzzy, you are now 10 units above where you are, that's

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.600
a write.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.240
So there is network synced, but the stuff in the middle, let's say it does a calculation

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:21.520
like, I don't know, the stars and their position in the world causes how far you get sent up.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.520
That calculation doesn't need to be network synchronized.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.200
Again, it really does depend on the setup.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.440
That also goes back to the updating relays, right?

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.280
The updating relays aren't needed when you're in the middle of like an impulse-based operation,

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.640
but it's really difficult to understand when they are and aren't needed, so just like try

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.760
it with and then remove it and see if it breaks.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:46.800
Moving forwards, I guess, like ask more questions if you need more support there.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.120
Fuzzy says, so that's why some people complain about writes because it causes updates.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.200
Yeah, they should stop complaining.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.120
If they've got dynamic bones, dynamic bones cause updates, right?

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.120
You know, like dynamic bones, moving your hand, grabbing something causes updates, complain

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.120
about that more.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.300
If you need to use writes, go for it.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.300
Sometimes you don't know.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.640
I do see people using like update a lot.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.640
That's again usually occurring on animations that are sorry, I don't know how to pronounce

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.160
that word, or the flickering light.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.160
That's the usual case.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.800
They're like writing the flickering light on and off, which is like a network update

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.740
every single like frame.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.740
Don't do that.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.640
Use T. At that point, yeah, you can be mad about the writes, but again, it's really kind

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.640
of like subtle.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:30.040
Moving onwards to bad halo ninja, it's best to hear from you, bad halo ninja, I used to

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040
see all the time.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.760
I'm sure you're working on some cool stuff.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.600
This is a bit of a back end question.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.600
Is last modifying user for sync values broken?

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.720
I've noticed that in the logs it tries to log it sometimes, but it never has a value.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.160
I've also tried using it sometimes in my mods and it's always null.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.160
I wouldn't know.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.160
I'd have to look into the actual code for that.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.600
As it's a mod, it's implicitly not supported, so I can't answer that open code base basically.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.960
I know that's like a frustrating answer, but that's unfortunately all I have for you on

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960
that one.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960
I believe that's all the time we have for questions.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.520
Farsi, if you have a question, go for it and type it, because you were typing it whilst

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520
I was closing off.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.520
So if you still have a question, go for it.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.520
Otherwise, we'll be closing off.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.480
This will be posted on Samba shortly with the silence removed.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.920
And if you have any questions or you want any follow-ups on any questions you've asked,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.720
please go ahead and direct message me anytime and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.680
Let's just wait for Farsi to stop typing.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.680
No pressure, Farsi.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.520
Okay, so Farsi's last question is, can mods do things for other users without them?

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:27.040
Do you mean moderators or Neos mods?

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.040
Modding.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.040
Yes.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.440
In fact, lots of the mods that we see are stuff that we want to add to Neos.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:39.020
I understand why they're added as mods, but a lot of them are basically just like, yo,

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.800
it's a feature that we want to add, but we just haven't had time to.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.200
And a lot of that then falls into the sort of umbrella term of shortcuts.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.760
I noticed yesterday actually there was a mod which added a button to the static audio clip

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760
which reverses it.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.420
So you can do reversing audio very easily.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.960
Great mod that adds that button.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.800
I love that someone did that and found it useful.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.000
I could probably add that quite quickly to Neos's actual source code if we weren't in

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.740
our current set of circumstances.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.120
So I might add that eventually.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.560
So it's a good example.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.560
Keep doing it.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.560
Don't feel bad about it.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.440
Do you read the modding policy?

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.900
Do you read the security reporting policy as well?

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.000
But yes, most mods are shortcuts, really.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I believe we're done.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.920
If there are any further questions, feel free to direct message me.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.800
Otherwise I'm going to leave off here.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.800
And I'll speak to you again soon.
